Albireo basiert auf der professionellen Open Source GIS Software „QGIS“. In Zusammenarbeit mit Ergnomen wurde ein auf die Anwendung zugeschnittenes Benutzerinterface geschaffen. Einerseits wurden zahlreiche nicht benötigte Geodatenverarbeitungsfunktionen weggelassen, andererseits gibt es auch Bereiche wie die Geländeanalyse, wo ein stark erweiterter Funktionsumfang zur Verfügung steht.\nNutzungsbedingungen\nKADAS Albireo steht unter der General Public License 2.0 (GPLv2).\nDie MSS/MilX Komponente ist Eigentum der Firma gs-soft AG.\nDie Nutzungsbedingungen für die Daten sind in der Anwendung unter Hilfe → Über aufgelistet.\nSystemanforderungen\n\nWindows 7 oder neuer, 64bit\n\nOpenGL fähige Grafikkarte\n\n10 GB Speicherplatz für Applikation und Grunddatensatzpaket\n\n\nVersionsprotokoll\nVersion 1.1 (November 2017)\n\nAllgemein:\nFrei setzbaren Cursor im Suchfeld\nHöhenanzeige in der Statusleiste\nGeschwindigkeitsverbesserungen bei der Kartendarstellung\nAttributtabelle für Vektorebenen\n\n\nAnalyse:\nGeodätische Distanz- und Flächenmessung\nAzimut wählbar relativ zum Kartennorden oder geographischen Norden\n\n\nZeichnen:\nEinschaltbares Snapping beim Zeichnen\nUndo/Redo beim Zeichnen\nZeichnung können verschoben, kopiert, ausgschnitten und eingefügt werden, einzeln oder als Gruppe\nBestehende Geometrien können fortgesetzt werden\nLaden von SVG Graphiken (u.a. SymTaZ Graphiken)\nLaden von nicht georeferenzierte Bilder\nBilder und Stecknadeln werden nun in entsprechende Ebenen abgelegt\n\n\nMSS:\nUpgrade auf MSS-2018\nKorrektes Grössenverhältnis von MSS Symbole beim Drucken\nKartuscheinhalt kann von und nach MilX oder XML Dateien importiert bzw. exportiert werden\nNumerische Eingabe von numerischen Attributen beim Zeichnen von MSS Symbole\n\n\n3D:\nUnterstützung für 3D Geometrien in der 3D-Ansicht\n\n\nDrucken:\nIm Projekt enthaltene Druckvorlagen können verwaltet werden\n\n\n\nVersion 1.0 (September 2016)\n\nInitiale Version\n\n"},"qgis_gui.html":{"url":"qgis_gui.html","title":"Programmoberfläche und Projektverwaltung","keywords":"","body":"Programmoberfläche und Projektverwaltung\n\nDas Applikationsfenster\nDas Applikationsfenster ist in folgende Bereiche unterteilt:\n\nMenubalken: Hier kann zwischen den Funktionalitäts-Registerkarten gewechselt werden.\n\nFunktionalitäts-Registerkarte: Hier befinden sich die Funktionalitäten.\n\nFavoriten: Funktionalitäten können hier per Drag-and-Drop platziert werden.\n\nKartenfenster: Hier wird die Karte dargestellt.\n\nGeodaten-Toolbar: Hier können lokale Geodaten der Karte hinzugefügt werden, der Geodatenkatalog neu geladen werden, sowie die Authentifizierung für den Zugang an geschützte Geodaten durchgeführt werden.\n\nGeodatenkatalog: Hier werden Ebenen aus Web-Services aufgelistet. Ebenen können per Drag-and-Drop oder Doppelklick hinzugefügt werden.\n\nEbenen (Karteninhaltsverzeichnis): Hier können die Ebenen der aktuell geladenen Karte verwaltet werden.\n\nStatuszeile: Hier wird die aktuelle Maus-Position über der Karte angezeigt, und kann Massstab, Anzeige sowie Projektions-koordinatenbezugssystem ausgewählt werden, sowie ein angeschlossener GPS Empfänger aktiviert werden.\n\nSuchfeld: Hier kann nach Ortschaften, Adressen, Koordinaten und in Ebenen gesucht werden.\n\nKartenkontextmenü: Hier werden kontextabhängig Funktionen für das ausgewählte Element angeboten, sowie vereinzelte wichtige Funktionalitäten der Registerkarten.\n\n\nNavigation in der Karte und Kartenwerkzeuge\nDie Navigation in der Karte erfolgt mit der linken oder mittleren Maustaste, das Zoomen mit dem Scrollrad oder mit den Zoom-Buttons rechts oben im Kartenfenster. Die rechte Maustaste öffnet das Kontextmenü. Bei Touch-fähigen Monitore werden die Pan und Rotationsgesten erkannt. Zusätzlich kann auf ein bestimmter Ausschnitt gezoomt werden, indem mit gedrückter Shift-Taste ein Rechteck aufgezogen wird.\nWenn kein Kartenwerkzeug aktiv ist, befindet man sich automatisch im Navigationsmodus. Ist ein Werkzeug (z.B. Messen oder Zeichnen) aktiv, ist die Schaltfläche in der entsprechenden Registerkarte das Werkzeug farblich hervorgehoben. Ein Werkzeug kann durch erneutes Drücken auf die entsprechende Schaltfläche wieder deaktiviert werden, oder alternativ durch Drücken der ESC Taste.\nUnabhängig vom aktiven Kartenwerkzeug dienen die mittlere Maustaste und das Scrollrad immer zur Kartennavigation. Die Funktion der linken Maustaste hängt vom aktiven Werkzeug ab.\nÜber die Funktionen Vorheriger Ausschnitt und Nächster Ausschnitt in der Registerkarte Ansicht kann auf vorher bzw. danach angezeigte Kartenausschnitte zurückgekehrt werden.\nGitter\nIn der Registerkarte Ansicht kann das Kartengitter aktiviert werden. Das Gitter basiert auf dem gewähltem Kartenkoordinatensystem.\nProjekte\nKarten können als Projekte geladen und gespeichert werden. Es wird das QGIS Projektformat verwendet, mit Endung *.qgs. Projekte werden aus Vorlagen erstellt. Beim Starten der Applikation wird automatisch ein Projekt aus einer Online- oder Offline-Vorlage erstellt, abhängig davon, ob der Rechner am Netz angeschlossen ist. Mit den Funktionen Neu, Öffnen, Speichern und Speichern als können neue Projekte (aus einer Vorlage) erstellt werden, existierende Projekte geöffnet werden und Projekte gespeichert werden.\nGewisse Werkzeuge erzeugen Datensätze, die in Ordner _files abgelegt werden.

It also allows the user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly (OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All of these features allow the user to display layers with different CRSs and have them overlay properly.\nOverview of Projection Support \nKADAS has support for approximately 2,700 known CRSs. Definitions for each CRS are stored in a SQLite database that is installed with KADAS. Normally, you do not need to manipulate the database directly. In fact, doing so may cause projection support to fail. Custom CRSs are stored in a user database. See section sec_custom_projections for information on managing your custom coordinate reference systems.\nThe CRSs available in KADAS are based on those defined by the European Petroleum Search Group (EPSG) and the Institut Geographique National de France (IGNF) and are largely abstracted from the spatial reference tables used in GDAL. EPSG identifiers are present in the database and can be used to specify a CRS in KADAS.\nIn order to use OTF projection, either your data must contain information about its coordinate reference system or you will need to define a global, layer or project-wide CRS. For PostGIS layers, KADAS uses the spatial reference identifier that was specified when the layer was created. For data supported by OGR, KADAS relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the CRS. In the case of shapefiles, this means a file containing the well-known text (WKT) specification of the CRS. This projection file has the same base name as the shapefile and a .prj extension. For example, a shapefile named alaska.shp would have a corresponding projection file named alaska.prj.\nThe CRS tab contains the following important components:\n\nFilter — If you know the EPSG code, the identifier, or the name for a coordinate reference system, you can use the search feature to find it. Enter the EPSG code, the identifier or the name.\nRecently used coordinate reference systems — If you have certain CRSs that you frequently use in your everyday GIS work, these will be displayed in this list. Click on one of these items to select the associated CRS.\nCoordinate reference systems of the world — This is a list of all CRSs supported by KADAS, including Geographic, Projected and Custom coordinate reference systems. To define a CRS, select it from the list by expanding the appropriate node and selecting the CRS. The active CRS is preselected.\nPROJ.4 text — This is the CRS string used by the PROJ.4 projection engine. This text is read-only and provided for informational purposes.\n\nDefault datum transformations \nOTF depends on being able to transform data into a ‘default CRS’, and KADAS uses WGS84. For some CRS there are a number of transforms available. KADAS allows you to define the transformation used otherwise KADAS uses a default transformation.\nKADAS asks which transformation to use by opening a dialogue box displaying PROJ.4 text describing the source and destination transforms. Further information may be found by hovering over a transform. User defaults can be saved by selecting  Remember selection.\n"},"print_composer/print_composer.html":{"url":"print_composer/print_composer.html","title":"Druckzusammenstellung","keywords":"","body":"Print Composer \nWith the Print Composer you can create nice maps and atlasses that can be printed or saved as PDF-file, an image or an SVG-file.

It allows you to add elements such as the KADAS map canvas, text labels, images, legends, scale bars, basic shapes, arrows, attribute tables and HTML frames. You can size, group, align, position and rotate each element and adjust the properties to create your layout. The layout can be printed or exported to image formats, PostScript, PDF or to SVG (export to SVG is not working properly with some recent Qt4 versions; you should try and check individually on your system).

The toolbar can be switched off and on using the right mouse button over the toolbar.\nOverview of the Print Composer \nOpening the Print Composer provides you with a blank canvas that represents the paper surface when using the print option. Initially you find buttons on the left beside the canvas to add map composer items; the current KADAS map canvas, text labels, images, legends, scale bars, basic shapes, arrows, attribute tables and HTML frames. In this toolbar you also find toolbar buttons to navigate, zoom in on an area and pan the view on the composer and toolbar buttons to select a map composer item and to move the contents of the map item.\nFigure_composer_overview shows the initial view of the Print Composer before any elements are added.\nFigure Composer Overview:\n\nPrint Composer \nOn the right beside the canvas you find two panels. The upper panel holds the tabs Items and Command History and the lower panel holds the tabs Composition, Item properties and Atlas generation.\n\nThe Items tab provides a list of all map composer items added to the canvas.\nThe Command history tab displays a history of all changes applied to the Print Composer layout. With a mouse click, it is possible to undo and redo layout steps back and forth to a certain status.\nThe Composition tab allows you to set paper size, orientation, the page background, number of pages and print quality for the output file in dpi. Furthermore, you can also activate the  Print as raster checkbox. This means all items will be converted to raster before printing or saving as PostScript or PDF. In this tab, you can also customize settings for grid and smart guides.\nThe Item Properties tab displays the properties for the selected item. Click the  Select/Move\\ item icon to select an item (e.g., legend, scale bar or label) on the canvas. Then click the Item Properties tab and customize the settings for the selected item.\nThe Atlas generation tab allows you to enable the generation of an atlas for the current Composer and gives access to its parameters.\nFinally, you can save your print composition with the  Save\\ Project button.\n\nIn the bottom part of the Print Composer window, you can find a status bar with mouse position, current page number and a combo box to set the zoom level.\nYou can add multiple elements to the Composer. It is also possible to have more than one map view or legend or scale bar in the Print Composer canvas, on one or several pages. Each element has its own properties and, in the case of the map, its own extent. If you want to remove any elements from the Composer canvas you can do that with the Delete or the Backspace key.\nNavigation tools \nTo navigate in the canvas layout, the Print Composer provides some general tools:\n\n Zoom\\ in\n Zoom\\ out\n Zoom\\ full\n Zoom\\ to\\ 100%\n Refresh\\ view (if you find the view in an inconsistent state)\n Pan\\ composer\n Zoom (zoom to a specific region of the Composer)\n\nYou can change the zoom level also using the mouse wheel or the combo box in the status bar. If you need to switch to pan mode while working in the Composer area, you can hold the Spacebar or the the mouse wheel. With Ctrl+Spacebar, you can temporarily switch to zoom mode, and with Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar, to zoom out mode.\nSample Session \nTo demonstrate how to create a map please follow the next instructions.\n\nOn the left site, select the  Add\\ new\\ map toolbar button and draw a rectangle on the canvas holding down the left mouse button. Inside the drawn rectangle the KADAS map view to the canvas.\nSelect the  Add\\ new\\ scalebar toolbar button and place the map item with the left mouse button on the Print Composer canvas. A scalebar will be added to the canvas.\nSelect the  Add\\ new\\ legend toolbar button and draw a rectangle on the canvas holding down the left mouse button. Inside the drawn rectangle the legend will be drawn.\nSelect the  Select/Move\\ item icon to select the map on the canvas and move it a bit.\nWhile the map item is still selected you can also change the size of the map item. Click while holding down the left mouse button, in a white little rectangle in one of the corners of the map item and drag it to a new location to change it’s size.\nClick the Item Properties tab on the left lower panel and find the setting for the orientation. Change the value of the setting Map orientation to ‘15.00° ‘. You should see the orientation of the map item change.\nFinally, you can save your print composition with the  Save\\ Project button.\n\nPrint Composer Options \nFrom Settings ‣ Composer Options you can set some options that will be used as default during your work.\n\nCompositions defaults let you specify the default font to use.\nWith Grid appearance, you can set the grid style and its color. There are three types of grid: Dots, Solid lines and Crosses.\nGrid and guide defaults defines spacing, offset and tolerance of the grid.\n\nComposition tab — General composition setup \nIn the Composition tab, you can define the global settings of your composition.\n\nYou can choose one of the Presets for your paper sheet, or enter your custom width and height.\nComposition can now be divided into several pages. For instance, a first page can show a map canvas, and a second page can show the attribute table associated with a layer, while a third one shows an HTML frame linking to your organization website. Set the Number of pages to the desired value. You can choose the page Orientation and its Exported resolution. When checked,  print as raster means all elements will be rasterized before printing or saving as PostScript or PDF.\nGrid and guides lets you customize grid settings like spacings, offsets and tolerance to your need. The tolerance is the maximum distance below which an item is snapped to smart guides.\n\nSnap to grid and/or to smart guides can be enabled from the View menu. In this menu, you can also hide or show the grid and smart guides.\nComposer items common options \nComposer items have a set of common properties you will find on the bottom of the Item Properties tab: Position and size, Rotation, Frame, Background, Item ID and Rendering (See figure_composer_common_1).\nFigure Composer Common 1:\n\nCommon Item properties Dialogs \n\nThe Position and size dialog lets you define size and position of the frame that contains the item. You can also choose which Reference point will be set at the X and Y coordinates previously defined.\nThe Rotation sets the rotation of the element (in degrees).\nThe  Frame shows or hides the frame around the label. Use the Frame color and Thickness menus to adjust those properties.\nUse the Background color menu for setting a background color. With the dialog you can pick a color (see Color Picker ).\nUse the Item ID to create a relationship to other Print Composer items. This is used with KADAS server and any potential web client. You can set an ID on an item (e.g., a map and a label), and then the web client can send data to set a property (e.g., label text) for that specific item. The GetProjectSettings command will list what items and which IDs are available in a layout.\nRendering mode can be selected in the option field. See Rendering_Mode.\n\nNote\n\nThe  Data\\ defined\\ override icon next to a field means that you can associate the field with data in the map item or use expressions. These are particularly helpful with atlas generation (See atlas_data_defined_overrides).\n\nKADAS now allows advanced rendering for Composer items just like vector and raster layers.\nFigure Composer common 2:\n\nRendering mode \n\nTransparency : You can make the underlying item in the Composer visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your item to your needs. You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the menu beside the slider.\n\n Exclude item from exports: You can decide to make an item not visible in all exports. After activating this checkbox, the item will not be included in PDF’s, prints etc..\n\nBlending mode: You can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you previously only may know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying items are mixed through the settings described below.\n\n\nNormal: This is the standard blend mode, which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the pixel beneath it; the colors aren’t mixed.\nLighten: This selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nScreen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer (e.g., you can use a hillshade to texture another layer).\nDodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So, brighter top pixels cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top pixels aren’t too bright; otherwise the effect is too extreme.\nAddition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with pixel values of the other. In case of values above 1 (as in the case of RGB), white is displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.\nDarken: This creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nMultiply: Here, the numbers for each pixel of the top layer are multiplied with the numbers for the corresponding pixel of the bottom layer. The results are darker pictures.\nBurn: Darker colors in the top layer cause the underlying layers to darken. Burn can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.\nOverlay: This mode combines the multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture, light parts become lighter and dark parts become darker.\nSoft light: This is very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This mode is supposed to emulate shining a soft light onto an image.\nHard light: Hard light is very similar to the overlay mode. It’s supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.\nDifference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel, or the other way around, to always get a positive value. Blending with black produces no change, as the difference with all colors is zero.\nSubtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer with pixel values of the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.\n\nThe Map item \n\n\n\nClick on the  Add\\ new\\ map toolbar button in the Print Composer toolbar to add the KADAS map canvas. Now, drag a rectangle onto the Composer canvas with the left mouse button to add the map. To display the current map, you can choose between three different modes in the map Item Properties tab:\n\nRectangle is the default setting. It only displays an empty box with a message ‘Map will be printed here’.\nCache renders the map in the current screen resolution. If you zoom the Composer window in or out, the map is not rendered again but the image will be scaled.\nRender means that if you zoom the Composer window in or out, the map will be rendered again, but for space reasons, only up to a maximum resolution.\n\nCache is the default preview mode for newly added Print Composer maps.\nYou can resize the map element by clicking on the  Select/Move\\ item button, selecting the element, and dragging one of the blue handles in the corner of the map. With the map selected, you can now adapt more properties in the map Item Properties tab.\nTo move layers within the map element, select the map element, click the  Move\\ item\\ content icon and move the layers within the map item frame with the left mouse button. After you have found the right place for an item, you can lock the item position within the Print Composer canvas. Select the map item and use the toolbar  Lock\\ Selected\\ Items or the Items tab to Lock the item. A locked item can only be selected using the Items tab. Once selected you can use the Items tab to unlock individual items. The Unlock\\ All\\ Items icon will unlock all locked composer items.\nMain properties \nThe Main properties dialog of the map Item Properties tab provides the following functionalities (see figure_composer_map_1):\nFigure Composer Map 1:\n\nMap Item properties Tab \n\nThe Preview area allows you to define the preview modes ‘Rectangle’, ‘Cache’ and ‘Render’, as described above. If you change the view on the KADAS map canvas by changing vector or raster properties, you can update the Print Composer view by selecting the map element in the Print Composer and clicking the [Update preview] button.\nThe field Scale  sets a manual scale.\nThe field Map rotation  allows you to rotate the map element content clockwise in degrees. The rotation of the map view can be imitated here. Note that a correct coordinate frame can only be added with the default value 0 and that once you defined a Map rotation it currently cannot be changed.\n Draw map canvas items lets you show annotations that may be placed on the map canvas in the main KADAS window.\nYou can choose to lock the layers shown on a map item. Check  Lock layers for map item. After this is checked, any layer that would be displayed or hidden in the main KADAS window will not appear or be hidden in the map item of the Composer. But style and labels of a locked layer are still refreshed according to the main KADAS interface. You can prevent this by using Lock layer styles for map item.\nThe  button allows you to add quickly all the presets views you have prepared in QGIS. Clicking on the  button you will see the list of all the preset views: just select the preset you want to display. The map canvas will automatically lock the preset layers by enabling the  Lock layers for map item: if you want to unselect the preset, just uncheck the  and press on the  button. See Map Legend to find out how to create presets views.\n\nExtents \nThe Extents dialog of the map item tab provides the following functionalities (see figure_composer_map_2):\nFigure Composer Map 2:\n\nMap Extents Dialog \n\nThe Map extents area allows you to specify the map extent using X and Y min/max values and by clicking the [Set to map canvas extent] button. This button sets the map extent of the composer map item to the extent of the current map view in the main KADAS application. The button [View extent in map canvas] does exactly the opposite, it updates the extent of the map view in the QGIS application to the extent of the composer map item.\n\nIf you change the view on the KADAS map canvas by changing vector or raster properties, you can update the Print Composer view by selecting the map element in the Print Composer and clicking the [Update preview] button in the map Item Properties tab (see figure_composer_map_1).\nGrids \nThe Grids dialog of the map Item Properties tab provides the possibility to add several grids to a map item.\n\nWith the plus and minus button you can add or remove a selected grid.\nWith the up and down button you can move a grid in the list and set the drawing priority.\n\nWhen you double click on the added grid you can give it another name.\nFigure Composer Map 3:\n\nMap Grids Dialog \nAfter you have added a grid, you can activate the checkbox  Show grid to overlay a grid onto the map element.

In the devisions section of the Grid Frame Dialog mentioned below you then have a corresponding setting. Symbology of the grid can be chosen. See section Rendering_Mode. Furthermore, you can define an interval in the X and Y directions, an X and Y offset, and the width used for the cross or line grid type.\nFigure Composer Map 5:\n\nGrid Frame Dialog \n\nThere are different options to style the frame that holds the map. Following options are available: No Frame, Zebra, Interior ticks, Exterior ticks, Interior and Exterior ticks and Lineborder.\nWith ‘LatitudeY/ only’ and ‘Longitude/X only’ setting in the devisions section you have the possibility to prevent a mix of latitude/y and longitude/x coordinates showing on a side when working with rotated maps or reprojected grids.\nAdvanced rendering mode is also available for grids (see section Rendering_mode).\nThe  Draw coordinates checkbox allows you to add coordinates to the map frame. You can choose the annotation numeric format, the options range from decimal to degrees, minute and seconds, with or without suffix, and aligned or not. You can choose which annotation to show. The options are: show all, latitude only, longitude only, or disable(none). This is useful when the map is rotated. The annotation can be drawn inside or outside the map frame. The annotation direction can be defined as horizontal, vertical ascending or vertical descending. In case of map rotation you can Finally, you can define the annotation font, the annotation font color, the annotation distance from the map frame and the precision of the drawn coordinates.\n\nFigure Composer map 6:\n\nGrid Draw Coordinates dialog \nOverviews \nThe Overviews dialog of the map Item Properties tab provides the following functionalities:\nFigure Composer Map 7:\n\nMap Overviews Dialog \nYou can choose to create an overview map, which shows the extents of the other map(s) that are available in the composer.

The last frame will be trimmed to fit the web page.\nRepeat on every page will repeat the upper left of the web page on every page in frames of the same size.\nRepeat until finished will also create as many frames as the Extend to next page option, except all frames will have the same size.\n\n\nUse the [Add Frame] button to add another frame with the same size as selected frame. If the HTML page that will not fit in the first frame it will continue in the next frame when you use Resize mode or Use existing frames.\nActivate  Don’t export page if frame is empty prevents the map layout from being exported when the frame has no HTML contents. This means all other composer items, maps, scalebars, legends etc. will not be visible in the result.\nActivate  Don’t draw background if frame is empty prevents the HTML frame being drawn if the frame is empty.\n\nUse smart page breaks and User style sheet \nThe Use smart page breaks dialog and Use style sheet dialog of the HTML frame Item Properties tab provides the following functionalities (see figure_composer_html_4):\nFigure Composer HTML 4:\n\nHTML frame, Use smart page breaks and User stylesheet properties \n\nActivate  Use smart page breaks to prevent the html frame contents from breaking mid-way a line of text so it continues nice and smooth in the next frame.\n\nSet the Maximum distance allowed when calculating where to place page breaks in the html. This distance is the maximum amount of empty space allowed at the bottom of a frame after calculating the optimum break location. Setting a larger value will result in better choice of page break location, but more wasted space at the bottom of frames. This is only used when Use smart page breaks is activated.\n\nActivate  User stylesheet to apply HTML styles that often is provided in cascading style sheets. An example of style code is provide below to set the color of  header tag to green and set the font and fontsize of text included in paragraph tags .\nh1 {color: #00ff00;\n}\np {font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\n   font-size: 20px;\n}\n\nUse the [Update HTML] button to see the result of the stylesheet settings.\n\n\nManage items \nSize and position \nEach item inside the Composer can be moved/resized to create a perfect layout. For both operations the first step is to activate the  Select/Move\\ item tool and to click on the item; you can then move it using the mouse while holding the left button. If you need to constrain the movements to the horizontal or the vertical axis, just hold the Shift while moving the mouse. If you need a better precision, you can move a selected item using the Arrow keys on the keyboard; if the movement is too slow, you can speed up it by holding Shift.\nA selected item will show squares on its boundaries; moving one of them with the mouse, will resize the item in the corresponding direction. While resizing, holding Shift will maintain the aspect ratio. Holding Alt will resize from the item center.\nThe correct position for an item can be obtained using snapping to grid or smart guides. Guides are set by clicking and dragging in the rulers. Guides are moved by clicking in the ruler, level with the guide and dragging to a new place. To delete a guide move it off the canvas. If you need to disable the snap on the fly just hold Ctrl while moving the mouse.\nYou can choose multiple items with the  Select/Move\\ item button. Just hold the Shift button and click on all the items you need. You can then resize/move this group just like a single item.\nOnce you have found the correct position for an item, you can lock it by using the items on the toolbar or ticking the box next to the item in the Items tab. Locked items are not selectable on the canvas.\nLocked items can be unlocked by selecting the item in the Items tab and unchecking the tickbox or you can use the icons on the toolbar.\nTo unselect an item, just click on it holding the Shift button.\nInside the Edit menu, you can find actions to select all the items, to clear all selections or to invert the current selection.\nAlignment \nRaising or lowering functionalities for elements are inside the  Raise\\ selected\\ items pull-down menu. Choose an element on the Print Composer canvas and select the matching functionality to raise or lower the selected element compared to the other elements (see table_composer_1). This order is shown in the Items tab. You can also raise or lower objects in the Items tab by clicking and dragging an object’s label in this list.\nFigure Composer 28:\n\nAlignment helper lines in the Print Composer \nThere are several alignment functionalities available within the  Align\\ selected\\ items pull-down menu (see table_composer_1). To use an alignment functionality, you first select some elements and then click on the matching alignment icon. All selected elements will then be aligned within to their common bounding box. When moving items on the Composer canvas, alignment helper lines appear when borders, centers or corners are aligned.\nCopy/Cut and Paste items \nThe print composer includes actions to use the common Copy/Cut/Paste functionality for the items in the layout. As usual first you need to select the items using one of the options seen above; at this point the actions can be found in the Edit menu. When using the Paste action, the elements will be pasted according to the current mouse position.\nNote\nHTML items can not be copied in this way. As a workaround, use the [Add Frame] button in the Item Properties tab.\nDuring the layout process, it is possible to revert and restore changes. This can be done with the revert and restore tools:\n\n Revert\\ last\\ change\n Restore\\ last\\ change\n\nThis can also be done by mouse click within the Command history tab (see figure_composer_29).\nFigure Composer 29:\n\nCommand history in the Print Composer \nThe Print Composer includes generation functions that allow you to create map books in an automated way. The concept is to use a coverage layer, which contains geometries and fields. For each geometry in the coverage layer, a new output will be generated where the content of some canvas maps will be moved to highlight the current geometry. Fields associated with this geometry can be used within text labels.\nEvery page will be generated with each feature. To enable the generation of an atlas and access generation parameters, refer to the Atlas generation tab. This tab contains the following widgets (see Figure_composer_atlas):\nFigure Composer Atlas:\n\nAtlas generation tab \n\n Generate an atlas, which enables or disables the atlas generation.\nA Coverage layer  combo box that allows you to choose the (vector) layer containing the geometries on which to iterate over.\nAn optional  Hidden coverage layer that, if checked, will hide the coverage layer (but not the other ones) during the generation.\nAn optional Filter with text area that allows you to specify an expression for filtering features from the coverage layer. If the expression is not empty, only features that evaluate to True will be selected. The button on the right allows you to display the expression builder.\nAn Output filename expression textbox that is used to generate a filename for each geometry if needed. It is based on expressions. This field is meaningful only for rendering to multiple files.\nA  Single file export when possible that allows you to force the generation of a single file if this is possible with the chosen output format (PDF, for instance). If this field is checked, the value of the Output filename expression field is meaningless.\nAn optional  Sort by that, if checked, allows you to sort features of the coverage layer. The associated combo box allows you to choose which column will be used as the sorting key. Sort order (either ascending or descending) is set by a two-state button that displays an up or a down arrow.\n\nYou can use multiple map items with the atlas generation; each map will be rendered according to the coverage features. To enable atlas generation for a specific map item, you need to check Controlled by Atlas under the item properties of the map item. Once checked, you can set:\n\nA radiobutton  Margin around feature that allows you to select the amount of space added around each geometry within the allocated map. Its value is meaningful only when using the auto-scaling mode.\nA  Predefined scale (best fit). It will use the best fitting option from the list of predefined scales in your project properties settings (see Project –> Project Properties –> General –> Project Scales to configure these predefined scales).\nA  Fixed scale that allows you to toggle between auto-scale and fixed-scale mode. In fixed-scale mode, the map will only be translated for each geometry to be centered. In auto-scale mode, the map’s extents are computed in such a way that each geometry will appear in its entirety.\n\nLabels \nIn order to adapt labels to the feature the atlas plugin iterates over, you can include expressions. For example, for a city layer with fields CITY_NAME and ZIPCODE, you could insert this:\nThe area of [% upper(CITY_NAME) || ',' || ZIPCODE || ' is ' format_number($area/1000000,2) %] km2\nThe information [% upper(CITY_NAME) || ‘,’ || ZIPCODE || ‘ is ‘ format_number($area/1000000,2) %] is an expression used inside the label. That would result in the generated atlas as:\nThe area of PARIS,75001 is 1.94 km2\nData Defined Override Buttons \nThere are several places where you can use a  Data\\ Defined\\ Override button to override the selected setting. These options are particularly usefull with Atlas Generation.\nFor the following examples the Regions layer of the KADAS sample dataset is used and selected for Atlas Generation. We also assume the paper format A4 (210X297) is selected in the Composition tab for field Presets.\nWith a Data Defined Override button you can dynamically set the paper orientation. When the height (north-south) of the extents of a region is greater than it’s width (east-west), you rather want to use portrait instead of landscape orientation to optimize the use of paper.\nIn the Composition you can set the field Orientation and select Landscape or Portrait. We want to set the orientation dynamically using an expression depending on the region geometry. press the  button of field Orientation, select Edit ... so the Expression string builder dialog opens. Give following expression:\nCASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 'Landscape' ELSE 'Portrait' END\nNow the paper orients itself automatically for each Region you need to reposition the location of the composer item as well. For the map item you can use the  button of field Width to set it dynamically using following expression:\n(CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) - 20\nUse the  button of field Heigth to provide following expression:\n(CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 210 ELSE 297 END) - 20\nWhen you want to give a title above map in the center of the page, insert a label item above the map. First use the item properties of the label item to set the horizontal alignment to  Center. Next activate from Reference point the upper middle checkbox. You can provide following expression for field X :\n(CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) / 2\nFor all other composer items you can set the position in a similar way so they are correctly positioned when page is automatically rotated in portrait or landscape.\nInformation provided is derived from the excellent blog (in english and portugese) on the Data Defined Override options Multiple_format_map_series_using_QGIS_2.6_ .\nThis is just one example of how you can use Data Defined Overrides.\nPreview \nOnce the atlas settings have been configured and map items selected, you can create a preview of all the pages by clicking on Atlas ‣ Preview Atlas and using the arrows, in the same menu, to navigate through all the features.\nGeneration \nThe atlas generation can be done in different ways. For example, with Atlas ‣ Print Atlas, you can directly print it. You can also create a PDF using Atlas ‣ Export Atlas as PDF: The user will be asked for a directory for saving all the generated PDF files (except if the  Single file export when possible has been selected). If you need to print just a page of the atlas, simply start the preview function, select the page you need and click on Composer ‣ Print (or create a PDF).\nTo maximise the space available to interact with a composition you can use View –>  Hide panels or press F10.\n:: note:\nIt's also possible to switch to a full screen mode to have more space to interact by pressing\n:kbd:`F11` or using :guilabel:`View --> |checkbox| :guilabel:`Toggle full screen`.\nFigure_composer_output shows the Print Composer with an example print layout, including each type of map item described in the sections above.\nFigure Composer Output:\n\nPrint Composer with map view, legend, image, scale bar, coordinates, text and HTML frame added \nBefore printing a layout you have the possibility to view your composition without bounding boxes. This can be enabled by deactivating View –>  Show bounding boxes or pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B.\nThe Print Composer allows you to create several output formats, and it is possible to define the resolution (print quality) and paper size:\n\nThe  Print icon allows you to print the layout to a connected printer or a PostScript file, depending on installed printer drivers.\nThe  Export\\ as\\ image icon exports the Composer canvas in several image formats, such as PNG, BPM, TIF, JPG,...\n Export\\ as\\ PDF saves the defined Print Composer canvas directly as a PDF.\nThe  Export\\ as\\ SVG icon saves the Print Composer canvas as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic).\n\nIf you need to export your layout as a georeferenced image (i.e., to load back inside KADAS), you need to enable this feature under the Composition tab. Check  World file on and choose the map item to use. With this option, the ‘Export as image’ action will also create a world file.\nNote\n\nCurrently, the SVG output is very basic. This is not a KADAS problem, but a problem with the underlying Qt library. This will hopefully be sorted out in future versions.\nExporting big rasters can sometimes fail, even if there seems to be enough memory. This is also a problem with the underlying Qt management of rasters.\n\n"},"working_with_vector/supported_data.html":{"url":"working_with_vector/supported_data.html","title":"Arbeiten mit Vektordaten","keywords":"","body":"Supported Data Formats \nKADAS uses the OGR library to read and write vector data formats, including ESRI shapefiles, MapInfo and MicroStation file formats, AutoCAD DXF, PostGIS, SpatiaLite, Oracle Spatial and MSSQL Spatial databases, and many more. GRASS vector and PostgreSQL support is supplied by native KADAS data provider plugins. Vector data can also be loaded in read mode from zip and gzip archives into KADAS. As of the date of this document, 69 vector formats are supported by the OGR library (see OGR-SOFTWARE-SUITE in literature_and_web). The complete list is available at http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html.\nESRI Shapefiles \nThe standard vector file format used in KADAS is the ESRI shapefile. Support is provided by the OGR Simple Feature Library (http://www.gdal.org/ogr/).\nA shapefile actually consists of several files. The following three are required:\n\n.shp file containing the feature geometries\n.dbf file containing the attributes in dBase format\n.shx index file\n\nShapefiles also can include a file with a .prj suffix, which contains the projection information. While it is very useful to have a projection file, it is not mandatory. A shapefile dataset can contain additional files. For further details, see the ESRI technical specification at http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf.\nLoading a Shapefile \nWhen loading a vector layer, the following dialog opens:\nFigure Vector 1:\n\nAdd Vector Layer Dialog \nFrom the available options check  File. Click on [Browse]. That will bring up a standard open file dialog (see figure_vector_2), which allows you to navigate the file system and load a shapefile or other supported data source. The selection box Filter  allows you to preselect some OGR-supported file formats.\nYou can also select the encoding for the shapefile if desired.\nFigure Vector 2:\n\nOpen an OGR Supported Vector Layer Dialog \nSelecting a shapefile from the list and clicking [Open] loads it into KADAS.\nTip\nLayer Colors\nWhen you add a layer to the map, it is assigned a random color. When adding more than one layer at a time, different colors are assigned to each layer.\nOnce a shapefile is loaded, you can zoom around it using the map navigation tools. To change the style of a layer, open the Layer Properties dialog by double clicking on the layer name or by right-clicking on the name in the legend and choosing Properties from the context menu. See section Style Menu for more information on setting symbology of vector layers.\nImproving Performance for Shapefiles \nTo improve the performance of drawing a shapefile, you can create a spatial index. A spatial index will improve the speed of both zooming and panning. Spatial indexes used by KADAS have a .qix extension.\nUse these steps to create the index:\n\nLoad a shapefile by clicking on the  Add\\ Vector\\ Layer toolbar button or pressing Ctrl+Shift+V.\nOpen the Layer Properties dialog by double-clicking on the shapefile name in the legend or by right-clicking and choosing Properties from the context menu.\nIn the General tab, click the [Create Spatial Index] button.\n\nProblem loading a shape .prj file \nIf you load a shapefile with a .prj file and KADAS is not able to read the coordinate reference system from that file, you will need to define the proper projection manually within the General tab of the Layer Properties dialog of the layer by clicking the [Specify...] button. This is due to the fact that .prj files often do not provide the complete projection parameters as used in KADAS and listed in the CRS dialog.\nFor the same reason, if you create a new shapefile with KADAS, two different projection files are created: a .prj file with limited projection parameters, compatible with ESRI software, and a .qpj file, providing the complete parameters of the used CRS. Whenever KADAS finds a .qpj file, it will be used instead of the .prj.\nLoading a MapInfo Layer \n To load a MapInfo layer, change the file type filter Files of type : to ‘Mapinfo File [OGR] (*.mif *.tab *.MIF *.TAB)’ and select the MapInfo layer you want to load.\nLoading an ArcInfo Binary Coverage \n To load an ArcInfo Binary Coverage, select  Directory as Source type. Change the file type filter Files of type  to ‘Arc/Info Binary Coverage’. Navigate to the directory that contains the coverage file, and select it.\nSimilarly, you can load directory-based vector files in the UK National Transfer Format, as well as the raw TIGER Format of the US Census Bureau.\n"},"working_with_vector/vector_properties.html":{"url":"working_with_vector/vector_properties.html","title":"Vektorlayereigenschaften","keywords":"","body":"The Vector Properties Dialog \nThe Layer Properties dialog for a vector layer provides information about the layer, symbology settings and labeling options. If your vector layer has been loaded from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS datastore, you can also alter the underlying SQL for the layer by invoking the Query Builder dialog on the General tab. To access the Layer Properties dialog, double-click on a layer in the legend or right-click on the layer and select Properties from the pop-up menu.\nFigure Vector Properties 1:\n\nVector Layer Properties Dialog \nStyle Menu \nThe Style menu provides you with a comprehensive tool for rendering and symbolizing your vector data. You can use Layer rendering ‣ tools that are common to all vector data, as well as special symbolizing tools that were designed for the different kinds of vector data.\nRenderers \nThe renderer is responsible for drawing a feature together with the correct symbol. There are four types of renderers: single symbol, categorized, graduated and rule-based. There is no continuous color renderer, because it is in fact only a special case of the graduated renderer. The categorized and graduated renderers can be created by specifying a symbol and a color ramp - they will set the colors for symbols appropriately. For point layers, there is a point displacement renderer available. For each data type (points, lines and polygons), vector symbol layer types are available. Depending on the chosen renderer, the Style menu provides different additional sections. On the bottom right of the symbology dialog, there is a [Symbol] button, which gives access to the Style Manager (see vector_style_manager). The Style Manager allows you to edit and remove existing symbols and add new ones.\nAfter having made any needed changes, the symbol can be added to the list of current style symbols (using [Symbol]  Save in symbol library), and then it can easily be used in the future. Furthermore, you can use the [Save Style]  button to save the symbol as a KADAS layer style file (.qml) or SLD file (.sld). SLDs can be exported from any type of renderer – single symbol, categorized, graduated or rule-based – but when importing an SLD, either a single symbol or rule-based renderer is created. That means that categorized or graduated styles are converted to rule-based. If you want to preserve those renderers, you have to stick to the QML format. On the other hand, it can be very handy sometimes to have this easy way of converting styles to rule-based.\nIf you change the renderer type when setting the style of a vector layer the settings you made for the symbol will be maintained. Be aware that this procedure only works for one change. If you repeat changing the renderer type the settings for the symbol will get lost.\nIf the datasource of the layer is a database (PostGIS or Spatialite for example), you can save your layer style inside a table of the database. Just click on Save Style comboxbox and choose Save in database item then fill in the dialog to define a style name, add a description, an ui file and if the style is a default style. When loading a layer from the database, if a style already exists for this layer, KADAS will load the layer and its style. You can add several style in the database. Only one will be the default style anyway.\nFigure Vector Properties 2:\n\nSave Style in database Dialog \nTip\nSelect and change multiple symbols\nThe Symbology allows you to select multiple symbols and right click to change color, transparency, size, or width of selected entries.\nSingle Symbol Renderer\nThe Single Symbol Renderer is used to render all features of the layer using a single user-defined symbol. The properties, which can be adjusted in the Style menu, depend partially on the type of layer, but all types share the following dialog structure. In the top-left part of the menu, there is a preview of the current symbol to be rendered. On the right part of the menu, there is a list of symbols already defined for the current style, prepared to be used by selecting them from the list. The current symbol can be modified using the menu on the right side.\nIf you click on the first level in the Symbol layers dialog on the left side, it’s possible to define basic parameters like Size, Transparency, color and Rotation. Here, the layers are joined together.\nFigure Symbology 3:\n\nSingle symbol line properties \nIn any spinbox in this dialog you can enter expressions. E.g. you can calculate simple math like multiplying the existing size of a point by 3 without resorting to a calculator.\nFigure Symbology 4:\n\nExpression in Size spinbox \nIf you click on the second level in the Symbol layers dialog a ‘Data-defined override’ for nearly all settings is possible. When using a data-defined color one may want to link the color to a field ‘budged’. Here a comment functionality is inserted.\n/* This expression will return a color code depending on the field value.\n * Negative value: red\n * 0 value: yellow\n * Positive value: green\n */\nCASE\n  WHEN value Figure Symbology 5:\n\nData-defined symbol with Edit... menu\nCategorized Renderer\nThe Categorized Renderer is used to render all features from a layer, using a single user-defined symbol whose color reflects the value of a selected feature’s attribute. The Style menu allows you to select:\n\nThe attribute (using the Column listbox or the  Set column expression function, see Expressions)\nThe symbol (using the Symbol dialog)\nThe colors (using the color Ramp listbox)\n\nThen click on Classify button to create classes from the distinct value of the attribute column. Each classes can be disabled unchecking the checkbox at the left of the class name.\nYou can change symbol, value and/or label of the class, just double click on the item you want to change.\nRight-click shows a contextual menu to Copy/Paste, Change color, Change transparency, Change output unit, Change symbol width.\nThe [Advanced] button in the lower-right corner of the dialog allows you to set the fields containing rotation and size scale information. For convenience, the center of the menu lists the values of all currently selected attributes together, including the symbols that will be rendered.\nThe example in figure_symbology_6 shows the category rendering dialog used for the rivers layer of the KADAS sample dataset.\nFigure Symbology 6:\n\nCategorized Symbolizing options \nGraduated Renderer\nThe Graduated Renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using a single user-defined symbol whose color reflects the assignment of a selected feature’s attribute to a class.\nFigure Symbology 7:\n\nGraduated Symbolizing options \nLike the Categorized Renderer, the Graduated Renderer allows you to define rotation and size scale from specified columns.\nAlso, analogous to the Categorized Renderer, the Style tab allows you to select:\n\nThe attribute (using the Column listbox or the  Set column expression function, see Expressions chapter)\nThe symbol (using the Symbol Properties button)\nThe colors (using the color Ramp list)\n\nAdditionally, you can specify the number of classes and also the mode for classifying features within the classes (using the Mode list). The available modes are:\n\nEqual Interval: each class has the same size (e.g. values from 0 to 16 and 4 classes, each class has a size of 4);\nQuantile: each class will have the same number of element inside (the idea of a boxplot);\nNatural Breaks (Jenks): the variance within each class is minimal while the variance between classes is maximal;\nStandard Deviation: classes are built depending on the standard deviation of the values;\nPretty Breaks: the same of natural breaks but the extremes number of each class are integers.\n\nThe listbox in the center part of the Style menu lists the classes together with their ranges, labels and symbols that will be rendered.\nClick on Classify button to create classes using the choosen mode. Each classes can be disabled unchecking the checkbox at the left of the class name.\nYou can change symbol, value and/or label of the clic, just double clicking on the item you want to change.\nRight-click shows a contextual menu to Copy/Paste, Change color, Change transparency, Change output unit, Change symbol width.\nThe example in figure_symbology_7 shows the graduated rendering dialog for the rivers layer of the KADAS sample dataset.\nTip\nThematic maps using an expression\nCategorized and graduated thematic maps can now be created using the result of an expression. In the properties dialog for vector layers, the attribute chooser has been augmented with a  Set column expression function. So now you no longer need to write the classification attribute to a new column in your attribute table if you want the classification attribute to be a composite of multiple fields, or a formula of some sort.\nRule-based rendering\nThe Rule-based Renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using rule based symbols whose color reflects the assignment of a selected feature’s attribute to a class. The rules are based on SQL statements. The dialog allows rule grouping by filter or scale, and you can decide if you want to enable symbol levels or use only the first-matched rule.\nThe example in figure_symbology_8 shows the rule-based rendering dialog for the rivers layer of the KADAS sample dataset.\nTo create a rule, activate an existing row by double-clicking on it, or click on ‘+’ and click on the new rule. In the Rule properties dialog, you can define a label for the rule. Press the  button to open the expression string builder. In the Function List, click on Fields and Values to view all attributes of the attribute table to be searched. To add an attribute to the field calculator Expression field, double click its name in the Fields and Values list. Generally, you can use the various fields, values and functions to construct the calculation expression, or you can just type it into the box (see Expressions). You can create a new rule by copying and pasting an existing rule with the right mouse button. You can also use the ‘ELSE’ rule that will be run if none of the other rules on that level match. The rules appear in a tree hierarchy in the map legend. Just double-klick the rules in the map legend and the Style menu of the layer properties appears showing the rule that is the background for the symbol in the tree.\nFigure Symbology 8:\n\nRule-based Symbolizing options \nPoint displacement\nThe Point Displacement Renderer works to visualize all features of a point layer, even if they have the same location. To do this, the symbols of the points are placed on a displacement circle around a center symbol.\nFigure Symbology 9:\n\nPoint displacement dialog \nTip\nExport vector symbology\nYou have the option to export vector symbology from KADAS into Google *.kml, *.dxf and MapInfo *.tab files. Just open the right mouse menu of the layer and click on Save selection as ‣ to specify the name of the output file and its format. In the dialog, use the Symbology export menu to save the symbology either as Feature symbology ‣ or as Symbol layer symbology ‣. If you have used symbol layers, it is recommended to use the second setting.\nInverted Polygon\nInverted polygon renderer allows user to define a symbol to fill in outside of the layer’s polygons. As before you can select subrenderers. These subrenderers are the same as for the main renderers.\nFigure Symbology 10:\n\nInverted Polygon dialog \nTip\nSwitch quickly between styles\nOnce you created one of the above mentioned styles you can right-klick on the layer and choose Styles ‣ Add to save your style. Now you can easily switch between styles you created using the Styles ‣ menu again.\nHeatmap\nWith the Heatmap renderer you can create live dynamic heatmaps for (multi)point layers. You can specify the heatmap radius in pixels, mm or map units, choose a color ramp for the heatmap style and use a slider for selecting a tradeoff between render speed and quality. When adding or removing a feature the heatmap renderer updates the heatmap style automatically.\nColor Picker \nRegardless the type of style to be used, the select color dialog will show when you click to choose a color - either border or fill color. This dialog has four different tabs which allow you to select colors by  color\\ ramp,  color\\ wheel,  color\\ swatches or  color\\ picker.\nWhatever method you use, the selected color is always described through color sliders for HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values. There is also an opacity slider to set transparency level. On the lower left part of the dialog you can see a comparison between the current and the new color you are presently selecting and on the lower right part you have the option to add the color you just tweaked into a color slot button.\nFigure color picker 1:\n\nColor picker ramp tab \nWith  color\\ ramp or with  color\\ wheel, you can browse to all possible color combinations. There are other possibilities though. By using color swatches  you can choose from a preselected list. This selected list is populated with one of three methods: Recent colors, Standard colors or Project colors\nFigure color picker 2:\n\nColor picker swatcher tab \nAnother option is to use the  color\\ picker which allows you to sample a color from under your mouse pointer at any part of QGIS or even from another application by pressing the space bar. Please note that the color picker is OS dependent and is currently not supported by OSX.\nTip\nquick color picker + copy/paste colors\nYou can quickly choose from Recent colors, from Standard colors or simply copy or paste a color by clicking the drop-down arrow that follows a current color box.\nFigure color picker 3:\n\nQuick color picker menu \nLayer rendering \n\nLayer transparency : You can make the underlying layer in the map canvas visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your vector layer to your needs. You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the the menu beside the slider.\n\n\n\nLayer blending mode and Feature blending mode: You can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you may previously only know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying layers are mixed through the settings described below.\nNormal: This is the standard blend mode, which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the pixel beneath it. The colors aren’t mixed.\nLighten: This selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nScreen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer (e.g., you can use a hillshade to texture another layer).\nDodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So, brighter top pixels cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top pixels aren’t too bright; otherwise the effect is too extreme.\nAddition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of values above one (in the case of RGB), white is displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.\nDarken: This creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nMultiply: Here, the numbers for each pixel of the top layer are multiplied with the corresponding pixels for the bottom layer. The results are darker pictures.\nBurn: Darker colors in the top layer cause the underlying layers to darken. Burn can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.\nOverlay: This mode combines the multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture, light parts become lighter and dark parts become darker.\nSoft light: This is very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This is supposed to emulate shining a soft light onto an image.\nHard light: Hard light is also very similar to the overlay mode. It’s supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.\nDifference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel, or the other way around, to always get a positive value. Blending with black produces no change, as the difference with all colors is zero.\nSubtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer from the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.\n\n\n\nLabels Menu \nThe  Labels core application provides smart labeling for vector point, line and polygon layers, and it only requires a few parameters. This new application also supports on-the-fly transformed layers. The core functions of the application have been redesigned. In KADAS, there are a number of other features that improve the labeling. The following menus have been created for labeling the vector layers:\n\nText\nFormatting\nBuffer\nBackground\nShadow\nPlacement\nRendering\n\nLet us see how the new menus can be used for various vector layers.\nLabeling point layers\nStart KADAS and load a vector point layer. Activate the layer in the legend and click on the  Layer\\ Labeling\\ Options icon in the KADAS toolbar menu.\nThe first step is to activate the  Label this layer with checkbox and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click  if you want to define labels based on expressions - See labeling_with_expressions.\nThe following steps describe a simple labeling without using the Data defined override functions, which are situated next to the drop-down menus.\nYou can define the text style in the Text menu (see Figure_labels_1 ). Use the Type case option to influence the text rendering. You have the possibility to render the text ‘All uppercase’, ‘All lowercase’ or ‘Capitalize first letter’. Use the blend modes to create effects known from graphics programs (see blend_modes).\nIn the Formatting menu, you can define a character for a line break in the labels with the ‘Wrap on character’ function. Use the  Formatted numbers option to format the numbers in an attribute table. Here, decimal places may be inserted. If you enable this option, three decimal places are initially set by default.\nTo create a buffer, just activate the  Draw text buffer checkbox in the Buffer menu. The buffer color is variable. Here, you can also use blend modes (see blend_modes).\nIf the  color buffer’s fill checkbox is activated, it will interact with partially transparent text and give mixed color transparency results. Turning off the buffer fill fixes that issue (except where the interior aspect of the buffer’s stroke intersects with the text’s fill) and also allows you to make outlined text.\nIn the Background menu, you can define with Size X and Size Y the shape of your background. Use Size type to insert an additional ‘Buffer’ into your background. The buffer size is set by default here. The background then consists of the buffer plus the background in Size X and Size Y. You can set a Rotation where you can choose between ‘Sync with label’, ‘Offset of label’ and ‘Fixed’. Using ‘Offset of label’ and ‘Fixed’, you can rotate the background. Define an Offset X,Y with X and Y values, and the background will be shifted. When applying Radius X,Y, the background gets rounded corners. Again, it is possible to mix the background with the underlying layers in the map canvas using the Blend mode (see blend_modes).\nUse the Shadow menu for a user-defined Drop shadow. The drawing of the background is very variable. Choose between ‘Lowest label component’, ‘Text’, ‘Buffer’ and ‘Background’. The Offset angle depends on the orientation of the label. If you choose the  Use global shadow checkbox, then the zero point of the angle is always oriented to the north and doesn’t depend on the orientation of the label. You can influence the appearance of the shadow with the Blur radius. The higher the number, the softer the shadows. The appearance of the drop shadow can also be altered by choosing a blend mode (see blend_modes).\nChoose the Placement menu for the label placement and the labeling priority. Using the  Offset from point setting, you now have the option to use Quadrants to place your label. Additionally, you can alter the angle of the label placement with the Rotation setting. Thus, a placement in a certain quadrant with a certain rotation is possible. In the priority section you can define with which priority the labels are rendered. It interacts with labels of the other vector layers in the map canvas. If there are labels from different layers in the same location then the label with the higher priority will be displayed and the other will be left out.\nIn the Rendering menu, you can define label and feature options. Under Label options, you find the scale-based visibility setting now. You can prevent KADAS from rendering only selected labels with the  Show all labels for this layer (including colliding labels) checkbox. Under Feature options, you can define whether every part of a multipart feature is to be labeled. It’s possible to define whether the number of features to be labeled is limited and to  Discourage labels from covering features.\nFigure Labels 1:\n\nSmart labeling of vector point layers \nLabeling line layers\nThe first step is to activate the  Label this layer checkbox in the Label settings tab and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click  if you want to define labels based on expressions - See labeling_with_expressions.\nAfter that, you can define the text style in the Text menu. Here, you can use the same settings as for point layers.\nAlso, in the Formatting menu, the same settings as for point layers are possible.\nThe Buffer menu has the same functions as described in section labeling_point_layers.\nThe Background menu has the same entries as described in section labeling_point_layers.\nAlso, the Shadow menu has the same entries as described in section labeling_point_layers.\nIn the Placement menu, you find special settings for line layers. The label can be placed  Parallel,  Curved or  Horizontal. With the  Parallel and  Curved option, you can define the position  Above line,  On line and  Below line. It’s possible to select several options at once. In that case, KADAS will look for the optimal position of the label. Remember that here you can also use the line orientation for the position of the label. Additionally, you can define a Maximum angle between curved characters when selecting the  Curved option (see Figure_labels_2 ).\nYou can set up a minimum distance for repeating labels. Distance can be in mm or in map units.\nSome Placement setup will display more options, for example, Curved and Parallel Placements will allow the user to set up the position of the label (above, below or on the line), distance from the line and for Curved, the user can also setup inside/outside max angle between curved label. As for point vector layers you have the possibility to define a Priority for the labels.\nThe Rendering menu has nearly the same entries as for point layers. In the Feature options, you can now Suppress labeling of features smaller than.\nFigure Labels 2:\n\nSmart labeling of vector line layers \nLabeling polygon layers\nThe first step is to activate the  Label this layer checkbox and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click  if you want to define labels based on expressions - See labeling_with_expressions.\nIn the Text menu, define the text style. The entries are the same as for point and line layers.\nThe Formatting menu allows you to format multiple lines, also similar to the cases of point and line layers.\nAs with point and line layers, you can create a text buffer in the Buffer menu.\nUse the Background menu to create a complex user-defined background for the polygon layer. You can use the menu also as with the point and line layers.\nThe entries in the Shadow menu are the same as for point and line layers.\nIn the Placement menu, you find special settings for polygon layers (see Figure_labels_3).  Offset from centroid,  Horizontal (slow),  Around centroid,  Free and  Using perimeter are possible.\nIn the  Offset from centroid settings, you can specify if the centroid is of the  visible polygon or  whole polygon. That means that either the centroid is used for the polygon you can see on the map or the centroid is determined for the whole polygon, no matter if you can see the whole feature on the map. You can place your label with the quadrants here, and define offset and rotation. The  Around centroid setting makes it possible to place the label around the centroid with a certain distance. Again, you can define  visible polygon or  whole polygon for the centroid. With the  Using perimeter settings, you can define a position and a distance for the label. For the position,  Above line,  On line,  Below line and  Line orientation dependent position are possible.\nRelated to the choice of Label Placement, several options will appear. As for Point Placement you can choose the distance for the polygon outline, repeat the label around the polygon perimeter.\nAs for point and line vector layers you have the possibility to define a Priority for the polygon vector layer.\nThe entries in the Rendering menu are the same as for line layers. You can also use Suppress labeling of features smaller than in the Feature options.\nFigure Labels 3:\n\nSmart labeling of vector polygon layers \nDefine labels based on expressions\nQGIS allows to use expressions to label features. Just click the  icon in the  Labels menu of the properties dialog. In figure_labels_4 you see a sample expression to label the alaska regions with name and area size, based on the field ‘NAME_2’, some descriptive text and the function ‘$area()’ in combination with ‘format_number()’ to make it look nicer.\nFigure Labels 4:\n\nUsing expressions for labeling \nExpression based labeling is easy to work with. All you have to take care of is, that you need to combine all elements (strings, fields and functions) with a string concatenation sign ‘||’ and that fields a written in “double quotes” and strings in ‘single quotes’. Let’s have a look at some examples:\n # label based on two fields 'name' and 'place' with a comma as separater\n \"name\" || ', ' || \"place\"\n\n -> John Smith, Paris\n\n # label based on two fields 'name' and 'place' separated by comma\n 'My name is ' || \"name\" || 'and I live in ' || \"place\"\n\n -> My name is John Smith and I live in Paris\n\n # label based on two fields 'name' and 'place' with a descriptive text\n # and a line break (\\n)\n 'My name is ' || \"name\" || '\\nI live in ' || \"place\"\n\n -> My name is John Smith\n    I live in Paris\n\n # create a multi-line label based on a field and the $area function\n # to show the place name and its area size based on unit meter.\n 'The area of ' || \"place\" || 'has a size of ' || $area || 'm²'\n\n -> The area of Paris has a size of 105000000 m²\n\n # create a CASE ELSE condition. If the population value in field\n # population is  This place is a town\nAs you can see in the expression builder, you have hundreds of functions available to create simple and very complex expressions to label your data in QGIS. See Expressions chapter for more information and examples on expressions.\nUsing data-defined override for labeling\nWith the data-defined override functions, the settings for the labeling are overridden by entries in the attribute table. You can activate and deactivate the function with the right-mouse button. Hover over the symbol and you see the information about the data-defined override, including the current definition field. We now describe an example using the data-defined override function for the Move\\ label function (see figure_labels_5 ).\n\nImport lakes.shp from the KADAS sample dataset.\nDouble-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Click on Labels and Placement. Select  Offset from centroid.\nLook for the Data defined entries. Click the  icon to define the field type for the Coordinate. Choose ‘xlabel’ for X and ‘ylabel’ for Y. The icons are now highlighted in yellow.\nZoom into a lake.\nGo to the Label toolbar and click the  icon. Now you can shift the label manually to another position (see figure_labels_6 ). The new position of the label is saved in the ‘xlabel’ and ‘ylabel’ columns of the attribute table.\n\nFigure Labels 5:\n\nLabeling of vector polygon layers with data-defined override \nFigure Labels 6:\n\nMove labels \nFields Menu \n Within the Fields menu, the field attributes of the selected dataset can be manipulated. The buttons  New\\ Column and  Delete\\ Column can be used when the dataset is in  Editing\\ mode.\nEdit Widget\nFigure Fields 1:\n\nDialog to select an edit widget for an attribute column \nWithin the Fields menu, you also find an edit widget column. This column can be used to define values or a range of values that are allowed to be added to the specific attribute table column. If you click on the [edit widget] button, a dialog opens, where you can define different widgets. These widgets are:\n\nCheckbox: Displays a checkbox, and you can define what attribute is added to the column when the checkbox is activated or not.\nClassification: Displays a combo box with the values used for classification, if you have chosen ‘unique value’ as legend type in the Style menu of the properties dialog.\nColor: Displays a color button allowing user to choose a color from the color dialog window.\nDate/Time: Displays a line field which can open a calendar widget to enter a date, a time or both. Column type must be text. You can select a custom format, pop-up a calendar, etc.\nEnumeration: Opens a combo box with values that can be used within the columns type. This is currently only supported by the PostgreSQL provider.\nFile name: Simplifies the selection by adding a file chooser dialog.\nHidden: A hidden attribute column is invisible. The user is not able to see its contents.\nPhoto: Field contains a filename for a picture. The width and height of the field can be defined.\nRange: Allows you to set numeric values from a specific range. The edit widget can be either a slider or a spin box.\nRelation Reference: This widged lets you embed the feature form of the referenced layer on the feature form of the actual layer. See vector_relations.\nText edit (default): This opens a text edit field that allows simple text or multiple lines to be used. If you choose multiple lines you can also choose html content.\nUnique values: You can select one of the values already used in the attribute table. If ‘Editable’ is activated, a line edit is shown with autocompletion support, otherwise a combo box is used.\nUUID Generator: Generates a read-only UUID (Universally Unique Identifiers) field, if empty.\nValue map: A combo box with predefined items. The value is stored in the attribute, the description is shown in the combo box. You can define values manually or load them from a layer or a CSV file.\nValue Relation: Offers values from a related table in a combobox. You can select layer, key column and value column.\nWebview: Field contains a URL. The width and height of the field is variable.\n\nNote\nKADAS has an advanced ‘hidden’ option to define your own field widget using python and add it to this impressive list of widgets. It is tricky but it is very well explained in following excellent blog that explains how to create a real time validation widget that can be used like described widgets. See http://blog.vitu.ch/10142013-1847/write-your-own-qgis-form-elements\nWith the Attribute editor layout, you can now define built-in forms (see figure_fields_2). This is usefull for data entry jobs or to identify objects using the option auto open form when you have objects with many attributes. You can create an editor with several tabs and named groups to present the attribute fields.\nChoose ‘Drag and drop designer’ and an attribute column. Use the  icon to create a category to insert a tab or a named group (see figure_fields_3). When creating a new category, KADAS will insert a new tab or named group for the category in the built-in form. The next step will be to assign the relevant fields to a selected category with the  icon. You can create more categories and use the same fields again.\nOther options in the dialog are ‘Autogenerate’ and ‘Provide ui-file’.\n\n‘Autogenerate’ just creates editors for all fields and tabulates them.\nThe ‘Provide ui-file’ option allows you to use complex dialogs made with the Qt-Designer. Using a UI-file allows a great deal of freedom in creating a dialog. For detailed information, see http://nathanw.net/2011/09/05/qgis-tips-custom-feature-forms-with-python-logic/.\n\nKADAS dialogs can have a Python function that is called when the dialog is opened. Use this function to add extra logic to your dialogs. An example is (in module MyForms.py):\ndef open(dialog,layer,feature):\ngeom = feature.geometry()\ncontrol = dialog.findChild(QWidged,\"My line edit\")\nReference in Python Init Function like so: MyForms.open\nMyForms.py must live on PYTHONPATH, in .qgis2/python, or inside the project folder.\nFigure Fields 2:\n\nDialog to create categories with the Attribute editor layout\nFigure Fields 3:\n\nResulting built-in form with tabs and named groups\nGeneral Menu \n Use this menu to make general settings for the vector layer. There are several options available:\nLayer Info\n\nChange the display name of the layer in displayed as\nDefine the Layer source of the vector layer\nDefine the Data source encoding to define provider-specific options and to be able to read the file\n\nCoordinate Reference System\n\nSpecify the coordinate reference system. Here, you can view or change the projection of the specific vector layer.\nCreate a Spatial Index (only for OGR-supported formats)\nUpdate Extents information for a layer\nView or change the projection of the specific vector layer, clicking on Specify ...\n\n Scale dependent visibility\n\nYou can set the Maximum (inclusive) and Minimum (exclusive) scale. The scale can also be set by the [Current] buttons.\n\nFeature subset\n\nWith the [Query Builder] button, you can create a subset of the features in the layer that will be visualized (also refer to section vector_query_builder).\n\nFigure General 1:\n\nGeneral menu in vector layers properties dialog \nRendering Menu \nKADAS supports for on-the-fly feature generalisation. This can improve rendering times when drawing many complex features at small scales. This feature can be enabled or disabled in the layer settings using the  Simplify geometry option. There is also a new global setting that enables generalisation by default for newly added layers (see section Options). Note: Feature generalisation may introduce artefacts into your rendered output in some cases. These may include slivers between polygons and inaccurate rendering when using offset-based symbol layers.\nDisplay Menu \n This menu is specifically created for Map Tips. It includes a new feature: Map Tip display text in HTML. While you can still choose a  Field to be displayed when hovering over a feature on the map, it is now possible to insert HTML code that creates a complex display when hovering over a feature. To activate Map Tips, select the menu option View ‣ MapTips. Figure Display 1 shows an example of HTML code.\nFigure Display 1:\n\nHTML code for map tip \nFigure Display 2:\n\nMap tip made with HTML code \nActions Menu \n KADAS provides the ability to perform an action based on the attributes of a feature. This can be used to perform any number of actions, for example, running a program with arguments built from the attributes of a feature or passing parameters to a web reporting tool.\nFigure Actions 1:\n\nOverview action dialog with some sample actions \nActions are useful when you frequently want to run an external application or view a web page based on one or more values in your vector layer. They are divided into six types and can be used like this:\n\nGeneric, Mac, Windows and Unix actions start an external process.\nPython actions execute a Python expression.\nGeneric and Python actions are visible everywhere.\nMac, Windows and Unix actions are visible only on the respective platform (i.e., you can define three ‘Edit’ actions to open an editor and the users can only see and execute the one ‘Edit’ action for their platform to run the editor).\n\nThere are several examples included in the dialog. You can load them by clicking on [Add default actions]. One example is performing a search based on an attribute value. This concept is used in the following discussion.\nDefining Actions\nAttribute actions are defined from the vector Layer Properties dialog. To define an action, open the vector Layer Properties dialog and click on the Actions menu. Go to the Action properties. Select ‘Generic’ as type and provide a descriptive name for the action. The action itself must contain the name of the application that will be executed when the action is invoked. You can add one or more attribute field values as arguments to the application. When the action is invoked, any set of characters that start with a % followed by the name of a field will be replaced by the value of that field. The special characters %% will be replaced by the value of the field that was selected from the identify results or attribute table (see using_actions below). Double quote marks can be used to group text into a single argument to the program, script or command. Double quotes will be ignored if preceded by a backslash.\nIf you have field names that are substrings of other field names (e.g., col1 and col10), you should indicate that by surrounding the field name (and the % character) with square brackets (e.g., [%col10]). This will prevent the %col10 field name from being mistaken for the %col1 field name with a 0 on the end. The brackets will be removed by KADAS when it substitutes in the value of the field. If you want the substituted field to be surrounded by square brackets, use a second set like this: [[%col10]].\nUsing the Identify Features tool, you can open the Identify Results dialog. It includes a (Derived) item that contains information relevant to the layer type. The values in this item can be accessed in a similar way to the other fields by preceeding the derived field name with (Derived).. For example, a point layer has an X and Y field, and the values of these fields can be used in the action with %(Derived).X and %(Derived).Y. The derived attributes are only available from the Identify Results dialog box, not the Attribute Table dialog box.\nTwo example actions are shown below:\n\nkonqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam\nkonqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%%\n\nIn the first example, the web browser konqueror is invoked and passed a URL to open. The URL performs a Google search on the value of the nam field from our vector layer. Note that the application or script called by the action must be in the path, or you must provide the full path. To be certain, we could rewrite the first example as: /opt/kde3/bin/konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam. This will ensure that the konqueror application will be executed when the action is invoked.\nThe second example uses the %% notation, which does not rely on a particular field for its value. When the action is invoked, the %% will be replaced by the value of the selected field in the identify results or attribute table.\nUsing Actions\nActions can be invoked from either the Identify Results dialog, an Attribute Table dialog or from Run Feature Action (recall that these dialogs can be opened by clicking  Identify\\ Features or  Open\\ Attribute\\ Table or  Run\\ Feature\\ Action). To invoke an action, right click on the record and choose the action from the pop-up menu. Actions are listed in the popup menu by the name you assigned when defining the action. Click on the action you wish to invoke.\nIf you are invoking an action that uses the %% notation, right-click on the field value in the Identify Results dialog or the Attribute Table dialog that you wish to pass to the application or script.\nHere is another example that pulls data out of a vector layer and inserts it into a file using bash and the echo command (so it will only work on  or perhaps ). The layer in question has fields for a species name taxon_name, latitude lat and longitude long. We would like to be able to make a spatial selection of localities and export these field values to a text file for the selected record (shown in yellow in the KADAS map area). Here is the action to achieve this:\nbash -c \"echo \\\"%taxon_name %lat %long\\\" >> /tmp/species_localities.txt\"\nAfter selecting a few localities and running the action on each one, opening the output file will show something like this:\nAcacia mearnsii -34.0800000000 150.0800000000\nAcacia mearnsii -34.9000000000 150.1200000000\nAcacia mearnsii -35.2200000000 149.9300000000\nAcacia mearnsii -32.2700000000 150.4100000000\nAs an exercise, we can create an action that does a Google search on the lakes layer. First, we need to determine the URL required to perform a search on a keyword. This is easily done by just going to Google and doing a simple search, then grabbing the URL from the address bar in your browser. From this little effort, we see that the format is http://google.com/search?q=qgis, where QGIS is the search term. Armed with this information, we can proceed:\n\nMake sure the lakes layer is loaded.\n\nOpen the Layer Properties dialog by double-clicking on the layer in the legend, or right-click and choose Properties from the pop-up menu.\n\nClick on the Actions menu.\n\nEnter a name for the action, for example Google Search.\n\nFor the action, we need to provide the name of the external program to run. In this case, we can use Firefox. If the program is not in your path, you need to provide the full path.\n\nFollowing the name of the external application, add the URL used for doing a Google search, up to but not including the search term: http://google.com/search?q=\n\nThe text in the Action field should now look like this: firefox http://google.com/search?q=\n\nClick on the drop-down box containing the field names for the lakes layer. It’s located just to the left of the [Insert Field] button.\n\nFrom the drop-down box, select ‘NAMES’ and click [Insert Field].\n\nYour action text now looks like this:\nfirefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES\n\nTo finalize the action, click the [Add to action list] button.\n\n\nThis completes the action, and it is ready to use. The final text of the action should look like this:\nfirefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES\nWe can now use the action. Close the Layer Properties dialog and zoom in to an area of interest. Make sure the lakes layer is active and identify a lake. In the result box you’ll now see that our action is visible:\nFigure Actions 2:\n\nSelect feature and choose action \nWhen we click on the action, it brings up Firefox and navigates to the URL http://www.google.com/search?q=Tustumena. It is also possible to add further attribute fields to the action. Therefore, you can add a + to the end of the action text, select another field and click on [Insert Field]. In this example, there is just no other field available that would make sense to search for.\nYou can define multiple actions for a layer, and each will show up in the Identify Results dialog.\nThere are all kinds of uses for actions. For example, if you have a point layer containing locations of images or photos along with a file name, you could create an action to launch a viewer to display the image. You could also use actions to launch web-based reports for an attribute field or combination of fields, specifying them in the same way we did in our Google search example.\nWe can also make more complex examples, for instance, using Python actions.\nUsually, when we create an action to open a file with an external application, we can use absolute paths, or eventually relative paths. In the second case, the path is relative to the location of the external program executable file. But what about if we need to use relative paths, relative to the selected layer (a file-based one, like a shapefile or SpatiaLite)? The following code will do the trick:\ncommand = \"firefox\";\nimagerelpath = \"images_test/test_image.jpg\";\nlayer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer();\nimport os.path;\nlayerpath = layer.source() if layer.providerType() == 'ogr'\n  else (qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI(layer.source()).database()\n  if layer.providerType() == 'spatialite' else None);\npath = os.path.dirname(str(layerpath));\nimage = os.path.join(path,imagerelpath);\nimport subprocess;\nsubprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );\nWe just have to remember that the action is one of type Python and the command and imagerelpath variables must be changed to fit our needs.\nBut what about if the relative path needs to be relative to the (saved) project file? The code of the Python action would be:\ncommand=\"firefox\";\nimagerelpath=\"images/test_image.jpg\";\nprojectpath=qgis.core.QgsProject.instance().fileName();\nimport os.path; path=os.path.dirname(str(projectpath)) if projectpath != '' else None;\nimage=os.path.join(path, imagerelpath);\nimport subprocess;\nsubprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );\nAnother Python action example is the one that allows us to add new layers to the project. For instance, the following examples will add to the project respectively a vector and a raster. The names of the files to be added to the project and the names to be given to the layers are data driven (filename and layername are column names of the table of attributes of the vector where the action was created):\nqgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer('/yourpath/[% \"filename\" %].shp','[% \"layername\" %]',\n  'ogr')\nTo add a raster (a TIF image in this example), it becomes:\nqgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer('/yourpath/[% \"filename\" %].tif','[% \"layername\" %]\n')\nJoins Menu \n The Joins menu allows you to join a loaded attribute table to a loaded vector layer. After clicking , the Add vector join dialog appears. As key columns, you have to define a join layer you want to connect with the target vector layer. Then, you have to specify the join field that is common to both the join layer and the target layer. Now you can also specify a subset of fields from the joined layer based on the checkbox  Choose which fields are joined. As a result of the join, all information from the join layer and the target layer are displayed in the attribute table of the target layer as joined information. If you specified a subset of fields only these fields are displayed in the attribute table of the target layer.\nKADAS currently has support for joining non-spatial table formats supported by OGR (e.g., CSV, DBF and Excel), delimited text and the PostgreSQL provider (see figure_joins_1).\nFigure Joins 1:\n\nJoin an attribute table to an existing vector layer \nAdditionally, the add vector join dialog allows you to:\n\n Cache join layer in virtual memory\n Create attribute index on the join field\n Choose which fields are joined\nCreate a  Custom field name prefix\n\nDiagrams Menu \n The Diagrams menu allows you to add a graphic overlay to a vector layer (see figure_diagrams_1).\nThe current core implementation of diagrams provides support for pie charts, text diagrams and histograms.\nThe menu is divided into four tabs: Appearance, Size, Postion and Options.\nIn the cases of the text diagram and pie chart, text values of different data columns are displayed one below the other with a circle or a box and dividers. In the Size tab, diagram size is based on a fixed size or on linear scaling according to a classification attribute. The placement of the diagrams, which is done in the Position tab, interacts with the new labeling, so position conflicts between diagrams and labels are detected and solved. In addition, chart positions can be fixed manually.\nFigure Diagrams 1:\n\nVector properties dialog with diagram menu \nWe will demonstrate an example and overlay on the Alaska boundary layer a text diagram showing temperature data from a climate vector layer. Both vector layers are part of the KADAS sample dataset (see section Sample Data).\n\nFirst, click on the  Load\\ Vector icon, browse to the KADAS sample dataset folder, and load the two vector shape layers alaska.shp and climate.shp.\nDouble click the climate layer in the map legend to open the Layer Properties dialog.\nClick on the Diagrams menu, activate Display diagrams, and from the Diagram type  combo box, select ‘Text diagram’.\nIn the Appearance tab, we choose a light blue as background color, and in the Size tab, we set a fixed size to 18 mm.\nIn the Position tab, placement could be set to ‘Around Point’.\nIn the diagram, we want to display the values of the three columns T_F_JAN, T_F_JUL and T_F_MEAN. First select T_F_JAN as Attributes and click the  button, then T_F_JUL, and finally T_F_MEAN.\nNow click [Apply] to display the diagram in the KADAS main window.\nYou can adapt the chart size in the Size tab. Deactivate the  Fixed size and set the size of the diagrams on the basis of an attribute with the [Find maximum value] button and the Size menu. If the diagrams appear too small on the screen, you can activate the  Increase size of small diagrams checkbox and define the minimum size of the diagrams.\nChange the attribute colors by double clicking on the color values in the Assigned attributes field. Figure_diagrams_2 gives an idea of the result.\nFinally, click [Ok].\n\nFigure Diagrams 2:\n\nDiagram from temperature data overlayed on a map \nRemember that in the Position tab, a  Data defined position of the diagrams is possible. Here, you can use attributes to define the position of the diagram. You can also set a scale-dependent visibility in the Appearance tab.\nThe size and the attributes can also be an expression. Use the  button to add an expression. See Expressions chapter for more information and example.\nMetadata Menu \n The Metadata menu consists of Description, Attribution, MetadataURL and Properties sections.\nIn the Properties section, you get general information about the layer, including specifics about the type and location, number of features, feature type, and editing capabilities. The Extents table provides you with layer extent information and the Layer Spatial Reference System, which is information about the CRS of the layer. This is a quick way to get information about the layer.\nAdditionally, you can add or edit a title and abstract for the layer in the Description section. It’s also possible to define a Keyword list here. These keyword lists can be used in a metadata catalogue. If you want to use a title from an XML metadata file, you have to fill in a link in the DataUrl field. Use Attribution to get attribute data from an XML metadata catalogue. In MetadataUrl, you can define the general path to the XML metadata catalogue. This information will be saved in the KADAS project file for subsequent sessions and will be used for KADAS server.\nFigure Metadata 1:\n\nMetadata menu in vector layers properties dialog \n"},"working_with_vector/expression.html":{"url":"working_with_vector/expression.html","title":"Ausdrücke","keywords":"","body":"Expressions \nThe Expressions feature are available through the field calculator or the add a new column button in the attribut table or the Field tab in the Layer properties ; through the graduaded, categorized and rule-based rendering in the Style tab of the Layer properties ; through the expression-based labeling  in the  Labeling core application ; through the feature selection and through the diagram tab of the Layer properties as well as the Main properties of the label item and the Atlas generation tab in the Print Composer.\nThey are a powerful way to manipulate attribute value in order to dynamically change the final value in order to change the geometry style, the content of the label, the value for diagram, select some feature or create virtual column.\nFunctions List \nThe Function List contains functions as well as fields and values. View the help function in the Selected Function Help. In Expression you see the calculation expressions you create with the Function List. For the most commonly used operators, see Operators.\nIn the Function List, click on Fields and Values to view all attributes of the attribute table to be searched. To add an attribute to the Field calculator Expression field, double click its name in the Fields and Values list. Generally, you can use the various fields, values and functions to construct the calculation expression, or you can just type it into the box. To display the values of a field, you just right click on the appropriate field. You can choose between Load top 10 unique values and Load all unique values. On the right side, the Field Values list opens with the unique values. To add a value to the Field calculator Expression box, double click its name in the Field Values list.\nThe Operators, Math, Conversions, String, Geometry and Record groups provide several functions. In Operators, you find mathematical operators. Look in Math for mathematical functions. The Conversions group contains functions that convert one data type to another. The String group provides functions for data strings. In the Geometry group, you find functions for geometry objects. With Record group functions, you can add a numeration to your data set. To add a function to the Field calculator Expression box, click on the > and then double click the function.\nOperators \nThis group contains operators (e.g., +, -, *).\na + b      a plus b\na - b

The results can be written to a new attribute field, a virtual field, or they can be used to update values in an existing field.\nTip\nVirtual Fields\n\nVirtual fields are not permanent and are not saved.\nTo make a field virtual it must be done when the field is made.\n\nThe field calculator is now available on any layer that supports edit. When you click on the field calculator icon the dialog opens (see figure_attributes_3). If the layer is not in edit mode, a warning is displayed and using the field calculator will cause the layer to be put in edit mode before the calculation is made.\nThe quick field calculation bar on top of the attribute table is only visible if the layer is editable.\nIn quick field calculation bar, you first select the existing field name then open the expression dialog to create your expression or write it directly in the field then click on Update All button.\nExpression tab \nIn the field calculator dialog, you first must select whether you want to only update selected features, create a new attribute field where the results of the calculation will be added or update an existing field.\nFigure Attributes 3:\n\nField Calculator \nIf you choose to add a new field, you need to enter a field name, a field type (integer, real or string), the total field width, and the field precision (see figure_attributes_3). For example, if you choose a field width of 10 and a field precision of 3, it means you have 6 digits before the dot, then the dot and another 3 digits for the precision.\nA short example illustrates how field calculator works when using the Expression tab.

The function editor will create new Python files in qgis2pythonexpressions and will auto load all functions defined when starting QGIS. Be aware that new functions are only saved in the expressions folder and not in the project file. If you have a project that uses one of your custom functions you will need to also share the .py file in the expressions folder.\nHere’s a short example on how to create your own functions:\n@qgsfunction(args=\"auto\", group='Custom')\ndef myfunc(value1, value2 feature, parent):\n    pass\nThe short example creates a function ‘myfunc’ that will give you a function with two values. When using the args=’auto’ function argument the number of function arguments required will be calculated by the number of arguments the function has been defined with in Python (minus 2 - feature, and parent).\nThis function then can be used with the following expression:\nmyfunc('test1', 'test2')\nYour function will be implemented in the ‘Custom’ Functions of the Expression tab after using the Run Script button.\nFurther information about creating Python code can be found on http://www.qgis.org/html/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html.\nThe function editor is not only limited to working with the field calculator, it can be found whenever you work with expressions. See also Expressions.\n"},"working_with_raster/supported_data.html":{"url":"working_with_raster/supported_data.html","title":"Arbeiten mit Rasterdaten","keywords":"","body":"Working with Raster Data \nThis section describes how to visualize and set raster layer properties. KADAS uses the GDAL library to read and write raster data formats, including ArcInfo Binary Grid, ArcInfo ASCII Grid, GeoTIFF, ERDAS IMAGINE, and many more. GRASS raster support is supplied by a native KADAS data provider plugin. The raster data can also be loaded in read mode from zip and gzip archives into KADAS.\nAs of the date of this document, more than 100 raster formats are supported by the GDAL library (see GDAL-SOFTWARE-SUITE in literature_and_web). A complete list is available at http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html.\nNote\nNot all of the listed formats may work in KADAS for various reasons. For example, some require external commercial libraries, or the GDAL installation of your OS may not have been built to support the format you want to use. Only those formats that have been well tested will appear in the list of file types when loading a raster into KADAS. Other untested formats can be loaded by selecting the [GDAL] All files (*) filter.\nWhat is raster data? \nRaster data in GIS are matrices of discrete cells that represent features on, above or below the earth’s surface. Each cell in the raster grid is the same size, and cells are usually rectangular (in KADAS they will always be rectangular). Typical raster datasets include remote sensing data, such as aerial photography, or satellite imagery and modelled data, such as an elevation matrix.\nUnlike vector data, raster data typically do not have an associated database record for each cell. They are geocoded by pixel resolution and the x/y coordinate of a corner pixel of the raster layer. This allows KADAS to position the data correctly in the map canvas.\nKADAS makes use of georeference information inside the raster layer (e.g., GeoTiff) or in an appropriate world file to properly display the data.\n"},"working_with_raster/raster_properties.html":{"url":"working_with_raster/raster_properties.html","title":"Dialogfenster Rasterlayereigenschaften","keywords":"","body":"Raster Properties Dialog \nTo view and set the properties for a raster layer, double click on the layer name in the map legend, or right click on the layer name and choose Properties from the context menu. This will open the Raster Layer Properties dialog (see figure_raster_1).\nThere are several menus in the dialog:\n\nGeneral\nStyle\nTransparency\nPyramids\nHistogram\nMetadata\n\nFigure Raster 1:\n\nRaster Layers Properties Dialog \nGeneral Menu \nLayer Info \nThe General menu displays basic information about the selected raster, including the layer source path, the display name in the legend (which can be modified), and the number of columns, rows and no-data values of the raster.\nCoordinate reference system \nHere, you find the coordinate reference system (CRS) information printed as a PROJ.4 string. If this setting is not correct, it can be modified by clicking the [Specify] button.\nScale Dependent visibility \nAdditionally scale-dependent visibility can be set in this tab. You will need to check the checkbox and set an appropriate scale where your data will be displayed in the map canvas.\nAt the bottom, you can see a thumbnail of the layer, its legend symbol, and the palette.\nStyle Menu \nBand rendering \nKADAS offers four different Render types. The renderer chosen is dependent on the data type.\n\nMultiband color - if the file comes as a multiband with several bands (e.g., used with a satellite image with several bands)\nPaletted - if a single band file comes with an indexed palette (e.g., used with a digital topographic map)\nSingleband gray - (one band of) the image will be rendered as gray; KADAS will choose this renderer if the file has neither multibands nor an indexed palette nor a continous palette (e.g., used with a shaded relief map)\nSingleband pseudocolor - this renderer is possible for files with a continuous palette, or color map (e.g., used with an elevation map)\n\nMultiband color\nWith the multiband color renderer, three selected bands from the image will be rendered, each band representing the red, green or blue component that will be used to create a color image. You can choose several Contrast enhancement methods: ‘No enhancement’, ‘Stretch to MinMax’, ‘Stretch and clip to MinMax’ and ‘Clip to min max’.\nFigure Raster 2:\n\nRaster Renderer - Multiband color \nThis selection offers you a wide range of options to modify the appearance of your raster layer. First of all, you have to get the data range from your image. This can be done by choosing the Extent and pressing [Load]. KADAS can  Estimate (faster) the Min and Max values of the bands or use the  Actual (slower) Accuracy.\nNow you can scale the colors with the help of the Load min/max values section. A lot of images have a few very low and high data. These outliers can be eliminated using the  Cumulative count cut setting. The standard data range is set from 2% to 98% of the data values and can be adapted manually. With this setting, the gray character of the image can disappear. With the scaling option  Min/max, KADAS creates a color table with all of the data included in the original image (e.g., KADAS creates a color table with 256 values, given the fact that you have 8 bit bands). You can also calculate your color table using the  Mean +/- standard deviation x . Then, only the values within the standard deviation or within multiple standard deviations are considered for the color table. This is useful when you have one or two cells with abnormally high values in a raster grid that are having a negative impact on the rendering of the raster.\nAll calculations can also be made for the  Current extent.\nTip\nViewing a Single Band of a Multiband Raster\nIf you want to view a single band of a multiband image (for example, Red), you might think you would set the Green and Blue bands to “Not Set”. But this is not the correct way. To display the Red band, set the image type to ‘Singleband gray’, then select Red as the band to use for Gray.\nPaletted\nThis is the standard render option for singleband files that already include a color table, where each pixel value is assigned to a certain color. In that case, the palette is rendered automatically. If you want to change colors assigned to certain values, just double-click on the color and the Select color dialog appears. Also, in KADAS 2.2. it’s now possible to assign a label to the color values. The label appears in the legend of the raster layer then.\nFigure Raster 3:\n\nRaster Renderer - Paletted \nContrast enhancement\nNote\nWhen adding GRASS rasters, the option Contrast enhancement will always be set automatically to stretch to min max, regardless of if this is set to another value in the KADAS general options.\nSingleband gray\nThis renderer allows you to render a single band layer with a Color gradient: ‘Black to white’ or ‘White to black’. You can define a Min and a Max value by choosing the Extent first and then pressing [Load]. KADAS can  Estimate (faster) the Min and Max values of the bands or use the  Actual (slower) Accuracy.\nFigure Raster 4:\n\nRaster Renderer - Singleband gray \nWith the Load min/max values section, scaling of the color table is possible. Outliers can be eliminated using the  Cumulative count cut setting. The standard data range is set from 2% to 98% of the data values and can be adapted manually. With this setting, the gray character of the image can disappear. Further settings can be made with  Min/max and  Mean +/- standard deviation x . While the first one creates a color table with all of the data included in the original image, the second creates a color table that only considers values within the standard deviation or within multiple standard deviations. This is useful when you have one or two cells with abnormally high values in a raster grid that are having a negative impact on the rendering of the raster.\nSingleband pseudocolor\nThis is a render option for single-band files, including a continous palette. You can also create individual color maps for the single bands here.\nFigure Raster 5:\n\nRaster Renderer - Singleband pseudocolor \nThree types of color interpolation are available:\n\nDiscrete\nLinear\nExact\n\nIn the left block, the button  Add\\ values\\ manually adds a value to the individual color table. The button  Remove\\ selected\\ row deletes a value from the individual color table, and the  Sort\\ colormap\\ items button sorts the color table according to the pixel values in the value column. Double clicking on the value column lets you insert a specific value. Double clicking on the color column opens the dialog Change color, where you can select a color to apply on that value. Further, you can also add labels for each color, but this value won’t be displayed when you use the identify feature tool. You can also click on the button  Load\\ color\\ map\\ from\\ band, which tries to load the table from the band (if it has any). And you can use the buttons  Load\\ color\\ map\\ from\\ file or  Export\\ color\\ map\\ to\\ file to load an existing color table or to save the defined color table for other sessions.\nIn the right block, Generate new color map allows you to create newly categorized color maps. For the Classification mode  ‘Equal interval’, you only need to select the number of classes  and press the button Classify. You can invert the colors of the color map by clicking the  Invert checkbox. In the case of the Mode  ‘Continous’, KADAS creates classes automatically depending on the Min and Max. Defining Min/Max values can be done with the help of the Load min/max values section. A lot of images have a few very low and high data. These outliers can be eliminated using the  Cumulative count cut setting. The standard data range is set from 2% to 98% of the data values and can be adapted manually. With this setting, the gray character of the image can disappear. With the scaling option  Min/max, KADAS creates a color table with all of the data included in the original image (e.g., KADAS creates a color table with 256 values, given the fact that you have 8 bit bands). You can also calculate your color table using the  Mean +/- standard deviation x . Then, only the values within the standard deviation or within multiple standard deviations are considered for the color table.\nColor rendering \nFor every Band rendering, a Color rendering is possible.\nYou can also achieve special rendering effects for your raster file(s) using one of the blending modes (see The Vector Properties Dialog).\nFurther settings can be made in modifiying the Brightness, the Saturation and the Contrast. You can also use a Grayscale option, where you can choose between ‘By lightness’, ‘By luminosity’ and ‘By average’. For one hue in the color table, you can modify the ‘Strength’.\nResampling \nThe Resampling option makes its appearance when you zoom in and out of an image. Resampling modes can optimize the appearance of the map. They calculate a new gray value matrix through a geometric transformation.\nFigure Raster 6:\n\nRaster Rendering - Resampling \nWhen applying the ‘Nearest neighbour’ method, the map can have a pixelated structure when zooming in. This appearance can be improved by using the ‘Bilinear’ or ‘Cubic’ method, which cause sharp features to be blurred. The effect is a smoother image. This method can be applied, for instance, to digital topographic raster maps.\nTransparency Menu \nKADAS has the ability to display each raster layer at a different transparency level. Use the transparency slider  to indicate to what extent the underlying layers (if any) should be visible though the current raster layer. This is very useful if you like to overlay more than one raster layer (e.g., a shaded relief map overlayed by a classified raster map). This will make the look of the map more three dimensional.\nAdditionally, you can enter a raster value that should be treated as NODATA in the Additional no data value menu.\nAn even more flexible way to customize the transparency can be done in the Custom transparency options section. The transparency of every pixel can be set here.\nAs an example, we want to set the water of our example raster file landcover.tif to a transparency of 20%. The following steps are neccessary:\n\nLoad the raster file landcover.tif.\nOpen the Properties dialog by double-clicking on the raster name in the legend, or by right-clicking and choosing Properties from the pop-up menu.\nSelect the Transparency menu.\nFrom the Transparency band menu, choose ‘None’.\nClick the  Add\\ values\\ manually button. A new row will appear in the pixel list.\nEnter the raster value in the ‘From’ and ‘To’ column (we use 0 here), and adjust the transparency to 20%.\nPress the [Apply] button and have a look at the map.\n\nYou can repeat steps 5 and 6 to adjust more values with custom transparency.\nAs you can see, it is quite easy to set custom transparency, but it can be quite a lot of work. Therefore, you can use the button  Export\\ to\\ file to save your transparency list to a file. The button  Import\\ from\\ file loads your transparency settings and applies them to the current raster layer.\nMetadata Menu \nThe Metadata menu displays a wealth of information about the raster layer, including statistics about each band in the current raster layer. From this menu, entries may be made for the Description, Attribution, MetadataUrl and Properties. In Properties, statistics are gathered on a ‘need to know’ basis, so it may well be that a given layer’s statistics have not yet been collected.\nFigure Raster 9:\n\nRaster Metadata \n"},"appendices/appendices.html":{"url":"appendices/appendices.html","title":"Anhang","keywords":"","body":"Anhang \nGNU General Public License \nDeutsche Übersetzung der Version 2, Juni 1991.

Sie sind nicht dafür verantwortlich, die Einhaltung dieser Lizenz durch Dritte durchzusetzen.\n\nSollten Ihnen infolge eines Gerichtsurteils, des Vorwurfs einer Patentverletzung oder aus einem anderen Grunde (nicht auf Patentfragen begrenzt) Bedingungen (durch Gerichtsbeschluß, Vergleich oder anderweitig) auferlegt werden, die den Bedingungen dieser Lizenz widersprechen, so befreien Sie diese Umstände nicht von den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz. Wenn es Ihnen nicht möglich ist, das Programm unter gleichzeitiger Beachtung der Bedingungen in dieser Lizenz und Ihrer anderweitigen Verpflichtungen zu verbreiten, dann dürfen Sie als Folge das Programm überhaupt nicht verbreiten. Wenn zum Beispiel ein Patent nicht die gebührenfreie Weiterverbreitung des Programms durch diejenigen erlaubt, die das Programm direkt oder indirekt von Ihnen erhalten haben, dann besteht der einzige Weg, sowohl das Patentrecht als auch diese Lizenz zu befolgen, darin, ganz auf die Verbreitung des Programms zu verzichten.\nSollte sich ein Teil dieses Paragraphen als ungültig oder unter bestimmten Umständen nicht durchsetzbar erweisen, so soll dieser Paragraph seinem Sinne nach angewandt werden; im übrigen soll dieser Paragraph als Ganzes gelten.\nZweck dieses Paragraphen ist nicht, Sie dazu zu bringen, irgendwelche Patente oder andere Eigentumsansprüche zu verletzen oder die Gültigkeit solcher Ansprüche zu bestreiten; dieser Paragraph hat einzig den Zweck, die Integrität des Verbreitungssystems der freien Software zu schützen, das durch die Praxis öffentlicher Lizenzen verwirklicht wird. Viele Leute haben großzügige Beiträge zu dem großen Angebot der mit diesem System verbreiteten Software im Vertrauen auf die konsistente Anwendung dieses Systems geleistet; es liegt am Autor/Geber, zu entscheiden, ob er die Software mittels irgendeines anderen Systems verbreiten will; ein Lizenznehmer hat auf diese Entscheidung keinen Einfluß.\nDieser Paragraph ist dazu gedacht, deutlich klarzustellen, was als Konsequenz aus dem Rest dieser Lizenz betrachtet wird.\n\nWenn die Verbreitung und/oder die Benutzung des Programms in bestimmten Staaten entweder durch Patente oder durch urheberrechtlich geschützte Schnittstellen eingeschränkt ist, kann der Urheberrechtsinhaber, der das Programm unter diese Lizenz gestellt hat, eine explizite geographische Begrenzung der Verbreitung angeben, in der diese Staaten ausgeschlossen werden, so daß die Verbreitung nur innerhalb und zwischen den Staaten erlaubt ist, die nicht ausgeschlossen sind. In einem solchen Fall beinhaltet diese Lizenz die Beschränkung, als wäre sie in diesem Text niedergeschrieben.\n\nDie Free Software Foundation kann von Zeit zu Zeit überarbeitete und/oder neue Versionen der General Public License veröffentlichen. Solche neuen Versionen werden vom Grundprinzip her der gegenwärtigen entsprechen, können aber im Detail abweichen, um neuen Problemen und Anforderungen gerecht zu werden.\nJede Version dieser Lizenz hat eine eindeutige Versionsnummer. Wenn in einem Programm angegeben wird, daß es dieser Lizenz in einer bestimmten Versionsnummer oder ‘’jeder späteren Version’’ (‘’any later version”) unterliegt, so haben Sie die Wahl, entweder den Bestimmungen der genannten Version zu folgen oder denen jeder beliebigen späteren Version, die von der Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht wurde. Wenn das Programm keine Versionsnummer angibt, können Sie eine beliebige Version wählen, die je von der Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht wurde.\n\nWenn Sie den Wunsch haben, Teile des Programms in anderen freien Programmen zu verwenden, deren Bedingungen für die Verbreitung anders sind, schreiben Sie an den Autor, um ihn um die Erlaubnis zu bitten. Für Software, die unter dem Copyright der Free Software Foundation steht, schreiben Sie an die Free Software Foundation; wir machen zu diesem Zweck gelegentlich Ausnahmen. Unsere Entscheidung wird von den beiden Zielen geleitet werden, zum einen den freien Status aller von unserer freien Software abgeleiteten Werke zu erhalten und zum anderen das gemeinschaftliche Nutzen und Wiederverwenden von Software im allgemeinen zu fördern.\n\n\nKeine Gewährleistung\n\nDa das Programm ohne jegliche Kosten lizenziert wird, besteht keinerlei Gewährleistung für das Programm, soweit dies gesetzlich zulässig ist. Sofern nicht anderweitig schriftlich bestätigt, stellen die Copyright-Inhaber und/oder Dritte das Programm so zur Verfügung, ‘’wie es ist’‘, ohne irgendeine Gewährleistung, weder ausdrücklich noch implizit, einschließlich - aber nicht begrenzt auf - Marktreife oder Verwendbarkeit für einen bestimmten Zweck. Das volle Risiko bezüglich Qualität und Leistungsfähigkeit des Programms liegt bei Ihnen. Sollte sich das Programm als fehlerhaft herausstellen, liegen die Kosten für notwendigen Service, Reparatur oder Korrektur bei Ihnen.\n\nIn keinem Fall, außer wenn durch geltendes Recht gefordert oder schriftlich zugesichert, ist irgendein Copyright-Inhaber oder irgendein Dritter, der das Programm wie oben erlaubt modifiziert oder verbreitet hat, Ihnen gegenüber für irgendwelche Schäden haftbar, einschließlich jeglicher allgemeiner oder spezieller Schäden, Schäden durch Seiteneffekte (Nebenwirkungen) oder Folgeschäden, die aus der Benutzung des Programms oder der Unbenutzbarkeit des Programms folgen (einschließlich - aber nicht beschränkt auf - Datenverluste, fehlerhafte Verarbeitung von Daten, Verluste, die von Ihnen oder anderen getragen werden müssen, oder dem Unvermögen des Programms, mit irgendeinem anderen Programm zusammenzuarbeiten), selbst wenn ein Copyright-Inhaber oder Dritter über die Möglichkeit solcher Schäden unterrichtet worden war.\n\n\nQGIS Qt Ausnahme für die GPL\n\nZusätzlich, als eine besondere Ausnahme, gibt das QGIS Development Team das Recht, den Quellcode dieses Programms mit der Qt-Bibliothek, einschliesslich aber nicht begrenzt auf die folgenden Versionen (frei und kommerziell): Qt/Non-commerical Windows, Qt/Windows, Qt/X11, Qt/Mac, und Qt/Embedded (oder mit modifizierten Qt-Versionen, welche die gleiche Lizenz wie Qt nutzen) zu verlinken und zu vertreiben. Für jeglichen Quellcode ausser dem Qt-Quellcode, müssen Sie die GNU General Public License in jeder Hinsicht befolgen. Wenn Sie diesen Text ändern, können Sie diese Ausnahmen erweitern zu Ihrer Version dieses Textes, aber Sie sind dazu nicht verpflichtet. Wenn Sie es nicht möchten, löschen Sie diese Ausnahme aus Ihrer Version.\n\nGNU Free Documentation License \n\nDies ist eine inoffizielle Übersetzung der GNU Free Documentation License (FDLv1.3) ins Deutsche. Sie wurde nicht von der Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht, und legt keine rechtsgültigen Bestimmungen zur Verteilung für Dokumentation fest, welche die GNU FDL verwendet - nur der englische Originaltext der GNU FDL gewährleistet dies. Dennoch hoffen wir, dass diese Übersetzung Deutsch sprechenden dazu verhilft, die GNU FDL besser zu verstehen\nCopyright 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc\nhttp://fsf.org/\nEs ist jedermann gestattet, diese Lizenzurkunde zu vervielfältigen und unveränderte Kopien zu verbreiten; Änderungen sind jedoch nicht erlaubt.\n\nEinleitung\nDer Zweck dieser Lizenz ist es, ein Handbuch, Fachbuch, oder ein anderes sachliches sowie nützliches Dokument ‘frei’ im Sinne von Freiheit anzufertigen: um jedermann die wirkliche Freiheit zuzusichern, es zu kopieren und neu zu verteilen, mit oder ohne Modifikation daran, entweder kommerziell oder nicht kommerziell. Zweitrangig erhält diese Lizenz für den Autor und Herausgeber die Möglichkeit aufrecht, Anerkennung für ihr Werk zu bekommen, während Sie nicht als verantwortlich betrachtet werden fürvorgenommene Modifikationen anderer.\nDiese Lizenz ist eine Art ‘Copyleft’, was bedeutet, dass abgeleitete Werke des Dokuments ihrerseits im selben Sinne frei sein müssen. Sie ergänzt die GNU General Public License, welche eine Copyleft-Lizenz darstellt, die für freie Software vorgesehen ist.\nWir haben diese Lizenz zur Verwendung für Handbücher von freier Software konzipiert, da freie Software freie Dokumentation benötigt: Ein freies Programm sollte mit Handbüchern erhältlich sein, welche dieselben Freiheiten zur Verfügung stellen wie es die Software tut. Doch diese Lizenz ist nicht auf Software-Handbücher beschränkt; sie kann für jedes textliche Werk verwendet werden, unabhängig vom Thema oder ob es als ein gedrucktes Buch veröffentlicht wird. Wir empfehlen diese Lizenz vorwiegend für Werke, deren Einsatzzweck Anleitung oder Referenz ist.\n1. Anwendbarkeit und Definitionen\nDiese Lizenz trifft auf jedes Handbuch oder sonstiges Werk zu, in beliebiger Form, das einen vom Urheberrechtsinhaber untergebrachten Hinweis mit den Worten enthält, dass es unter den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz verteilt werden kann. Solch ein Hinweis gewährt eine weltweite, vergütungsfreie Lizenz von unbefristeter Dauer, um dieses Werk unter den hier festgelegten Bedingungen zu verwenden. Das ‘Dokument’, nachstehend, bezieht sich auf jedes derartige Handbuch oder Werk. Jedes Mitglied der Öffentlichkeit ist ein Lizenznehmer und wird als ‘Sie’ angesprochen. Sie akzeptieren die Lizenz, wenn Sie die Werke kopieren, modifizieren oder verteilen, was gewissermaßen unter dem Urheberrechtsgesetz die Erlaubnis erfordert.\nEine modifizierte Version des Dokumentes bedeutet, dass jedes Werk das Dokument selbst oder einen Teil davon beinhaltet, entweder unverändert kopiert, oder mit Modifikationen und/oder übersetzt in eine andere Sprache.\nEin untergeordneter Abschnitt ist ein benannter Anhang oder ein Titelei-Abschnitt des Dokuments, der sich ausschließlich mit dem Verhältnis der Herausgeber oder Autoren des Dokuments zum Gesamtthema des Dokuments befasst (oder damit in Verbindung stehende Bewandtnisse), und nichts beinhaltet was direkt innerhalb des Gesamtthemas fallen könnte. (Wenn das Dokument zu einem Fachbuch über Mathematik gehört, kann ein untergeordneter Abschnitt folglich nichts Mathematisches erläutern.) Die Beziehung könnte ein Anliegen mit historischer Verbindung zum Thema oder ähnlicher Angelegenheiten, oder bezüglich ihrer rechtlichen, kommerziellen, philosophischen, ethischen oder politischen Position sein.\nDie ‘unveränderlichen Abschnitte’ sind bestimmte untergeordnete Abschnitte, deren Titel zum Beispiel in dem Hinweis, der besagt, dass das Dokument unter dieser Lizenz freigegeben ist, als jene unveränderlichen Abschnitte gekennzeichnet sind. Wenn ein Abschnitt nicht zur obigen Definition von untergeordnet passt, dann ist es nicht erlaubt ihn als unveränderlich zu kennzeichnen. Das Dokument kann null unveränderliche Abschnitte enthalten. Wenn das Dokument keine unveränderlichen Abschnitte kennzeichnet, dann gibt es keine.\nDie ‘Umschlagtexte’ sind bestimmte kurze Textpassagen die als vordere Umschlagtexte oder hintere Umschlagtexte in dem Hinweis, der besagt, dass das Dokument unter dieser Lizenz freigegeben ist, verzeichnet sind. Ein vorderer Umschlagtext darf höchstens 5 Wörter lang sein, und ein hinterer Umschlagtext darf höchstens 25 Wörter lang sein.\nEine ‘transparente’ Kopie des Dokumentes bedeutet eine maschinenlesbare Kopie, in einem ansehnlichen Format, dessen Spezifikation für die Allgemeinheit verfügbar ist, welches geeignet ist das Dokument unkompliziert mit allgemeinen Texteditoren oder (für aus Pixeln bestehende Bilder) allgemeinen Malprogrammen oder (für Zeichnungen) irgendeinem weit verbreiteten Zeicheneditor zu überarbeiten, und das geeignet ist zur Eingabe in Textformatierer oder zur automatischen Übersetzung in eine Variante von geeigneten Formaten zur Eingabe in Textformatierer. Eine Kopie, erstellt in einem ansonsten transparenten Dateiformat, dessen Auszeichnung oder fehlende Auszeichnung derart ausgestaltet wurde, um nachträgliche Modifikation durch Leser zu behindern oder zu verhindern, ist nicht transparent. Ein Bildformat ist nicht transparent, wenn es für irgendeine beträchtliche Menge von Text verwendet wird. Eine Kopie, die nicht ‘transparent’ ist, wird ‘undurchlässig’ genannt.\nBeispiele von geeigneten Formaten für transparente Kopien beinhalten einfachen ASCII ohne Auszeichnung, Texinfo Eingabeformat, LaTeX Eingabeformat, SGML oder XML unter Verwendung einer öffentlich zugänglichen DTD, und standardkonformes einfaches HTML, PostScript oder PDF, vorgesehen für humane Modifikation. Beispiele für transparente Bildformate beinhalten PNG, XCF und JPG. Undurchlässige Formate beinhalten proprietäre Formate die nur mit proprietären Textverarbeitungssystemen gelesen und bearbeitet werden können, SGML oder XML für welche die DTD und/oder Bearbeitungswerkzeuge nicht allgemein verfügbar sind, und das maschinengenerierte HTML, PostScript oder PDF, erzeugt mit irgendwelchen Textverarbeitungssystemen, nur für Ausgabezwecke.\nDas ‘Titelblatt’ bedeutet, für ein gedrucktes Buch, das Titelblatt an sich zzgl. solcher nachfolgenden Seiten die notwendig sind, die Lesbarkeit des Materials beizubehalten, wie von dieser Lizenz erfordert, um im Titelblatt zu erscheinen. Für Werke in Formaten, welche kein Titelblatt als solches haben, bedeutet ‘Titelblatt’ der Text nahe dem bedeutendsten Auftreten des Titels dieses Werkes, ausgehend vom Anfang des Textkörpers.\nDer ‘Herausgeber’ ist jede Person oder Instanz, welche Kopien des Dokuments an die Öffentlichkeit verteilt.\nEin Abschnitt Mit dem Titel XYZ bedeutet eine benannte Untereinheit des Dokuments, dessen Titel entweder genau XYZ ist, oder XYZ in runden Klammern, gefolgt von Text, welcher XYZ in eine andere Sprache übersetzt. (Hier steht XYZ für einen spezifischen Abschnittsnamen, weiter unten erwähnt, wie zum Beispiel ‘Danksagungen’, ‘Widmungen’, ‘Befürwortungen’ oder ‘Verlauf’.) Den ‘Titel’ eines solchen Abschnitts ‘zu erhalten’, wenn Sie das Dokument modifizieren, bedeutet, dass dieser ein Abschnitt ‘Mit dem Titel XYZ’ gemäß seiner Definition bleibt.\nDas Dokument kann neben dem Hinweis, der festlegt, dass diese Lizenz auf das Dokument zutrifft, Garantie-Ausschlussklauseln beinhalten. Diese Garantie-Ausschlussklauseln werden als aufgenommen betrachtet, durch Verweis in dieser Lizenz, aber nur was die Ausschließung von Garantien betrifft: Jede andere Auswirkung, die diese Garantie-Ausschlussklauseln haben können, ist ungültig und hat keine Wirkung auf die Bedeutung dieser Lizenz.\n2. Unveränderte Vervielfältigung\nSie dürfen das Dokument in beliebiger Form kopieren und verteilen, entweder kommerziell oder nicht kommerziell, vorausgesetzt, dass diese Lizenz, die Urheberrechtshinweise und der Lizenzhinweis mit den Worten, dass diese Lizenz auf das Dokument zutrifft, in allen Kopien wiedergegeben werden, und dass Sie keine anderen Bedingungen, welcher Art auch immer, zu jenen dieser Lizenz hinzufügen. Sie dürfen keine technischen Maßnahmen anwenden die das Lesen oder weitere Vervielfältigung von den Kopien, die Sie erstellen oder verteilen, behindern oder kontrollieren. Allerdings können Sie Bezahlung im Austausch für Kopien entgegennehmen. Wenn Sie eine ausreichend große Anzahl von Kopien verteilen, müssen Sie außerdem die Bedingungen in Abschnitt 3 beachten.\nSie dürfen außerdem Kopien verleihen, unter den selben, oben angegebenen Bedingungen, und Sie dürfen Kopien öffentlich auslegen.\n3. Vervielfältigung grosser Mengen\nWenn Sie, mehr als 100 umfassend, gedruckte Kopien eines Dokuments veröffentlichen (oder Kopien in Medien, die üblicherweise gedruckte Umschläge haben) und der Lizenzhinweis des Dokuments Umschlagtexte erfordert, müssen Sie die Kopien in Umschläge beifügen, welche eindeutig und leserlich alle diese Umschlagtexte tragen: vordere Umschlagtexte auf vordere Umschläge, und hintere Umschlagtexte auf hintere Umschläge. Beide Umschläge müssen, ebenso eindeutig und leserlich, Sie, als den Herausgeber dieser Kopien, identifizieren. Der vordere Umschlag muss den vollständigen Titel, mit allen Wörtern des Titels, in gleicher Weise auffallend und leicht erkennbar darstellen. Sie dürfen darüber hinaus sonstiges Material auf die Umschläge anbringen. Vervielfältigung mit Änderungen, begrenzt auf die Umschläge, sofern sie den Titel des Dokuments erhalten und diese Bedingungen erfüllen, können ansonsten als unveränderte Vervielfältigung behandelt werden.\nWenn die erforderlichen Texte für beide Umschläge zu umfangreich sind, um lesbar zu passen, sollten Sie die ersten verzeichneten (so viele, um angemessen zu passen) auf den aktuellen Umschlag setzen, und den Rest auf den nachfolgenden Seiten fortsetzen.\nWenn Sie, mehr als 100 umfassend, undurchlässige Kopien des Dokuments veröffentlichen oder verteilen, müssen Sie entweder eine maschinenlesbare transparente Kopie zusammen mit jeder undurchlässigen Kopie einbeziehen, oder in bzw. mit jeder undurchlässigen Kopie eine Computer-Netzwerkadresse angeben, von welcher die allgemeine netzwerknutzende Öffentlichkeit, unter Verwendung von Netzwerkprotokollen öffentlicher Standards, Zugang hat, um eine vollständig transparente Kopie, frei von hinzugefügtem Material, herunterzuladen. Falls Sie die letzte Option verwenden, müssen Sie angemessen überlegte Schritte unternehmen, wenn Sie mit der Verteilung von undurchlässigen Kopien in großen Mengen beginnen, um sicherzustellen, dass diese transparente Kopie unter der angegebenen Adresse auf diese Weise zugänglich bleibt, bis mindestens ein Jahr nachdem Sie zum letzten Mal eine undurchlässige Kopie (unmittelbar oder durch Ihre Vertreter oder Einzelhändler) in dieser Ausgabe an die Öffentlichkeit verteilen.\nEs ist erwünscht, aber nicht erforderlich, dass Sie in Kontakt mit den Autoren des Dokuments treten, kurz bevor Sie irgendeine große Anzahl von Kopien neu verteilen, um ihnen die Möglichkeit zu geben, Sie mit einer aktualisierten Version des Dokuments zu versorgen.\n4. Modifikationen\nSie dürfen eine modifizierte Version des Dokuments unter den oben erwähnten Bedingungen der Abschnitte 2 und 3 kopieren und verteilen, vorausgesetzt, dass Sie die modifizierte Version unter genau dieser Lizenz freigeben, mit der modifizierten Version wird die Rolle des Dokuments besetzt, und somit der Lizenzierung von Verteilung und Modifikation der modifizierten Version, für jeden der eine Kopie davon besitzt. Zusätzlich müssen Sie diese Sachen in der modifizierten Version erledigen:\n\nVerwenden Sie auf dem Titelblatt (und gegebenenfalls auf den Umschlägen) einen Titel der sich von dem des Dokuments unterscheidet, und von jenen der vorhergehenden Versionen (die, wenn es irgendwelche gab, in dem Verlaufs-Abschnitt des Dokuments verzeichnet sein sollten). Sie dürfen denselben Titel wie den einer vorhergehenden Version verwenden, wenn der ursprüngliche Herausgeber dieser Version die Erlaubnis gibt.\n\nVerzeichnen Sie auf dem Titelblatt, als Autoren, eine oder mehrere Personen oder Organe, verantwortlich für die Autorschaft der Modifikationen in der modifizierten Version, zusammen mit mindestens fünf der Hauptautoren des Dokuments (alle seine Hauptautoren, wenn es weniger als fünf hat), es sei denn, dass sie Sie von dieser Anforderung befreien.\n\nGeben Sie auf dem Titelblatt den Namen des Herausgebers der modifizierten Version als den des Herausgebers an.\n\nErhalten Sie alle Urheberrechtshinweise des Dokumentes.\n\nFügen Sie einen entsprechenden Urheberrechtshinweis für Ihre Modifikationen, angrenzend zu den anderen Urheberrechtshinweisen, hinzu.\n\nNehmen Sie, direkt nach den Urheberrechtshinweisen, einen Lizenzhinweis auf, der die öffentliche Erlaubnis gibt, die modifizierte Version unter den Bestimmungen dieser Lizenz zu verwenden, in der Form, wie weiter unten im Anhang gezeigt.\n\nErhalten Sie in diesem Lizenzhinweis die vollständigen Listen der unveränderlichen Abschnitte und erforderlichen Umschlagtexte, aufgeführt in dem Lizenzhinweis des Dokuments.\n\nNehmen Sie eine ungeänderte Kopie dieser Lizenz auf.\n\nErhalten Sie den Abschnitt mit dem Titel ‘Verlauf’, erhalten Sie seinen Titel und fügen Sie ihm einen Punkt hinzu, der mindestens den Titel, das Jahr, neue Autoren und Herausgeber der modifizierte Version angibt, wie auf dem Titelblatt aufgeführt. Wenn es keinen Abschnitt ‘Verlauf’ in dem Dokument gibt, erzeugen Sie einen, der den Titel, das Jahr, die Autoren und Herausgeber des Dokuments angibt, wie auf seinem Titelblatt aufgeführt, dann fügen Sie einen Punkt hinzu, der die modifizierte Version beschreibt, wie in dem vorhergehenden Satz angegeben.\n\nErhalten Sie gegebenenfalls die Netzwerkadresse, aufgeführt in dem Dokument, für den öffentlichen Zugang zu einer transparenten Kopie des Dokuments, und ebenso die in dem Dokument aufgeführten Netzwerkadressen, für vorhergehende Versionen, auf dem es beruht. Diese können in den Abschnitt ‘Verlauf’ untergebracht werden. Sie dürfen eine Netzwerkadresse für ein Werk auslassen, das mindestens vier Jahre vor dem Dokument selbst veröffentlicht wurde, oder der ursprüngliche Herausgeber der Version, auf die es sich bezieht, die Erlaubnis gibt.\n\nFür jeden Abschnitt mit dem Titel ‘Danksagungen’ oder ‘Widmungen’, erhalten Sie den Titel des Abschnitts, und erhalten Sie in dem Abschnitt vollständig den wesentlichen Gehalt und Umgangston der, von jeglichen Mitwirkenden darin aufgeführten, Danksagungen und/oder Widmungen.\n\nErhalten Sie alle unveränderlichen Abschnitte des Dokuments, ungeändert in ihrem Text und ihren Titeln. Abschnittsnummern oder Entsprechendes werden nicht als Teil der Abschnittstitel betrachtet.\n\nLöschen Sie jeden Abschnitt mit dem Titel ‘Befürwortungen’. Solch ein Abschnitt darf nicht in die modifizierte Version aufgenommen werden.\n\nBetiteln Sie keinen Titel eines vorhandenen Abschnitts neu, der mit ‘Befürwortung’ betitelt ist oder in Konflikt zum Titel irgendeines unveränderlichen Abschnitts steht.\n\nErhalten Sie jegliche Garantie-Ausschlussklauseln.\n\n\nWenn die modifizierte Version neue Titelei-Abschnitte oder Anhänge beinhaltet, die als untergeordnete Abschnitte qualifiziert sind und kein kopiertes Material aus dem Dokument enthalten, können Sie Ihrer Wahl nach einige oder alle diese Abschnitte als unveränderlich bestimmen. Um dies zu tun, fügen Sie ihre Titel zur Liste der unveränderlichen Abschnitte in den Lizenzhinweis der modifizierten Version hinzu. Diese Titel müssen sich von allen anderen Abschnittstitel unterscheiden.\nSie können einen Abschnitt mit dem Titel ‘Befürwortungen’ hinzufügen, vorausgesetzt, dass dieser nichts enthält als nur Befürwortungen Ihrer modifizierten Version durch verschiedene Parteien Beispiel Aussagen der Begutachtung oder dass der Text von einer Organisation als maßgebliche Definition eines Standards anerkannt worden ist.\nSie können eine Textpassage von bis zu fünf Wörtern als einen vorderen Umschlagtext, und eine Textpassage von bis zu 25 Wörtern als hinteren Umschlagtext in der modifizierten Version hinzufügen. Nur eine Textpassage des vorderen Umschlagtextes und eine des hinteren Umschlagtextes kann von (oder durch, von ihr, angefertigte Zusammenstellung) irgendeiner Person hinzugefügt werden. Wenn das Dokument bereits einen Umschlagtext für denselben Umschlag beinhaltet, zuvor von Ihnen hinzugefügt oder durch Zusammenstellung, angefertigt von derselben Person, in dessen Namen Sie handeln, können Sie keinen weiteren hinzufügen; aber Sie dürfen den alten ersetzen, mit ausdrücklicher Erlaubnis des vorherigen Herausgebers, welcher den alten hinzufügte.\nDer/die Autor(en) und Herausgeber des Dokuments geben durch diese Lizenz für keine modifizierte Version die Erlaubnis ihre Namen für Werbung zu verwenden oder Befürwortung zu behaupten oder anzudeuten.\n5. Dokumente kombinieren\nSie dürfen das Dokument mit anderen, unter dieser Lizenz freigegeben, Dokumenten kombinieren, unter den Bestimmungen, definiert in Abschnitt 4 für modifizierte Versionen, vorausgesetzt, dass Sie in die Kombination alle unveränderlichen Abschnitte aller Originaldokumente, nicht modifiziert, einbeziehen und sie alle als unveränderliche Abschnitte Ihres kombinierten Werkes in dessen Lizenzhinweis verzeichnen, und dass Sie alle ihre Garantie-Ausschlussklauseln erhalten.\nDas kombinierte Werk muss nur eine Kopie dieser Lizenz enthalten, und mehrfach identische unveränderliche Abschnitte können gegen eine einzelne Kopie ausgetauscht werden. Wenn es mehrfach identische unveränderliche Abschnitte mit demselben Namen, aber unterschiedlichem Inhalt gibt, erzeugen Sie den Titel eines jeden solchen Abschnitts an seinem Ende eindeutig durch Hinzufügen, in runden Klammern, des Namens, falls bekannt, des ursprünglichen Autors oder Herausgebers dieses Abschnittes, oder andernfalls einer eindeutigen Nummer. Nehmen Sie dieselbe Anpassung bei den Abschnittstiteln in der Liste von unveränderlichen Abschnitten in dem Lizenzhinweis des kombinierten Werkes vor.\nIn der Kombination müssen Sie jegliche Abschnitte mit dem Titel ‘Verlauf’ in den verschiedenen Originaldokumenten kombinieren und einen Abschnitt mit dem Titel ‘Verlauf’ bilden; ebenso kombinieren Sie jegliche Abschnitte mit dem Titel ‘Danksagungen’, und jegliche Abschnitte mit dem Titel ‘Widmungen’. Sie müssen alle Abschnitte mit dem Titel ‘Befürwortungen’ löschen.\n6. Sammlungen von Dokumenten\nSie dürfen eine Sammlung erzeugen, bestehend aus dem Dokument und anderen Dokumenten, freigegeben unter dieser Lizenz, und die Einzel-Kopien dieser Lizenz in den verschiedenen Dokumenten gegen eine einzelne Kopie, die in die Sammlung aufgenommen wird, austauschen, vorausgesetzt, dass Sie die Regeln dieser Lizenz für unveränderte Vervielfältigung jedes Dokuments in jeder anderen Hinsicht befolgen.\nSie dürfen ein einzelnes Dokument aus solch einer Sammlung entnehmen, und es individuell unter dieser Lizenz verteilen, vorausgesetzt, dass Sie eine Kopie dieser Lizenz in das extrahierte Dokument einfügen, und diese Lizenz in jeder anderen Hinsicht, bezüglich der unveränderten Vervielfältigung dieses Dokuments, befolgen.\n7. Gruppierung mit unabhängigen Werken\nEine Zusammentragung des Dokuments oder seiner Ableitungen mit anderen gesonderten und unabhängigen Dokumenten oder Werken, in oder zu einem Band auf einem Speicher- oder Verteilungsmedium, wird eine ‘Gruppierung’ genannt, wenn das Urheberrecht, das sich aus der Zusammentragung ergibt, nicht verwendet wird, um die gültigen Rechte der Benutzer dieser Zusammentragungen darüber hinaus, was die Einzel-Werke gestatten, zu beschränken. Wenn das Dokument in eine Gruppierung aufgenommen ist, trifft diese Lizenz nicht auf die anderen Werke in der Gruppierung zu, welche nicht selbst abgeleitete Werke des Dokuments sind.\nWenn die Anforderung für Umschlagtext von Abschnitt 3 auf diese Kopien des Dokuments anwendbar ist, wenn außerdem das Dokument weniger als eine Hälfte der gesamten Gruppierung darstellt, kann der Umschlagtext des Dokuments auf Umschläge, die das Dokument innerhalb der Gruppierung einklammern, untergebracht werden, oder der elektronischen Entsprechung von Umschlägen, wenn das Dokument in elektronischer Form vorliegt. Andernfalls müssen sie auf gedruckten Umschlägen vorkommen, welche die vollständige Gruppierung einklammern.\n8. Übersetzung\nÜbersetzung wird als eine Art von Modifikation betrachtet, also dürfen Sie Übersetzungen unter den Bestimmungen von Abschnitt 4 verteilen. Das Austauschen unveränderlicher Abschnitte mit Übersetzungen erfordert besondere Erlaubnis von ihren Urheberrechtsinhabern, aber Sie können Übersetzungen von einigen oder allen unveränderlichen Abschnitten aufnehmen, zusätzlich zu den Originalversionen dieser unveränderlichen Abschnitte. Sie können eine Übersetzung dieser Lizenz aufnehmen, und alle Lizenzhinweise in dem Dokument, und jegliche Garantie-Ausschlussklauseln, vorausgesetzt, dass Sie außerdem die englische Originalversion dieser Lizenz und die Originalversionen jener Hinweise und Ausschlussklauseln aufnehmen. Im Falle eines Widerspruchs zwischen der Übersetzung und der Originalversion dieser Lizenz oder eines Hinweises oder einer Ausschlussklausel, wird sich die Originalversion durchsetzen.\nWenn ein Abschnitt in dem Dokument mit ‘Danksagungen’, ‘Widmungen’ oder ‘Verlauf’ betitelt ist, wird die Anforderung (Abschnitt 4), seinen Titel (Abschnitt 1) zu erhalten, normalerweise die Änderung des tatsächlichen Titels erfordern.\n9. Schlussbestimmung\nSie dürfen das Dokument nicht kopieren, modifizieren, unterlizenzieren oder verteilen, außer, als ausdrücklich unter dieser Lizenz zur Verfügung gestellt. Jeder andere Versuch es zu kopieren, zu modifizieren, zu unterlizenzieren oder zu verteilen ist ungültig, und wird automatisch Ihre Rechte unter dieser Lizenz aufkündigen.\nJedoch, wenn Sie jeglichen Verstoß gegen diese Lizenz beenden, dann ist ihre Lizenz eines bestimmten Urheberrechtsinhabers wieder (a) vorläufig, sofern und solange der Urheberrechtsinhaber nicht ihre Lizenz beendet, und (b) dauerhaft, wenn der Urheberrechtsinhaber es versäumt, Sie über den Verstoß zu benachrichtigen, mit angemessenen Mitteln, vorzeitig 60 Tage nach der Beendigung.\nDarüber hinaus ist Ihre Lizenz eines bestimmten Urheberrechtsinhabers wieder dauerhaft, wenn der Urheberrechtsinhaber Sie über den Verstoß mit angemessenen Mitteln benachrichtigt, es das erste Mal ist, dass Sie eine Benachrichtigung über den Verstoß dieser Lizenz (für jedes Werk) vom Urheberrechtsinhaber erhalten, und Sie den Verstoß vorzeitig 30 Tage nach Erhalt der Benachrichtigung beseitigen.\nDie Beendigung Ihrer Rechte unter diesem Abschnitt beendet nicht die Lizenzen der Parteien, welche Kopien oder Rechte von Ihnen unter dieser Lizenz erhalten haben. Wenn Ihre Rechte aufgekündigt und nicht wieder dauerhaft geworden sind, gibt Ihnen der Erhalt einer Kopie von Teilen oder Sämtlichem des gleichen Materials keine Rechte, diese zu verwenden.\n10. Zukünftige Überarbeitungen dieser Lizenz\nDie Free Software Foundation kann von Zeit zu Zeit neue, überarbeitete Versionen der GNU-Lizenz für freie Dokumentation veröffentlichen. Solche neuen Versionen werden im Geist zur gegenwärtigen Version gleich sein, aber können sich im Detail unterscheiden, um neue Probleme oder Anliegen anzusprechen. Sehen Sie http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\nJeder Version der Lizenz wird eine charakteristische Versionsnummer gegeben. Wenn das Dokument spezifiziert, dass eine besonders nummerierte Version dieser Lizenz ‘oder jede spätere Version’ auf sich zutrifft, haben Sie die Wahl den Bestimmungen und Bedingungen entweder dieser spezifizierten Version oder jeder späteren Version, die (nicht als Entwurf) durch die Free Software Foundation veröffentlicht worden ist, zu folgen. Wenn das Dokument spezifiziert, dass ein Bevollmächtigter entscheiden darf welche zukünftigen Versionen dieser Lizenz verwendet werden können, berechtigt Sie das dauerhaft, durch die öffentliche Aussage desjenigen Bevollmächtigten über die Akzeptanz einer Version, diese Version für das Dokument zu wählen.\n11. Relizenzierung\n“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) meint jeglichen World Wide Web Server, welcher urheberrechtsfähige Werke veröffentlicht und ferner bedeutende Möglichkeiten für jeden bietet, solche Werke zu editieren. Ein öffentliches Wiki, welches jeder bearbeiten kann, ist ein Beispiel eines solchen Servers. Eine ‘Massives Multiautor Collaboration’ (oder ‘MMC’), enthalten im Standort, bedeutet jegliche Zusammenstellung urheberrechtsfähiger Werke, die folglich auf dem MMC-Standort veröffentlicht werden.\n“CC-BY-SA” meint die Creative Commons Namensnennung-Weitergabe unter gleichen Bedingungen 3.0 Lizenz, veröffentlicht von der Creative Commons Corporation, einem gemeinnützigen Unternehmen mit Hauptgeschäftssitz in San Francisco, Californien, sowie zukünftige Copyleft-Versionen dieser Lizenz, welche durch dieselbe Organisation veröffentlicht wird.\n“Einbeziehen” bedeutet, ein Dokument zu veröffentlichen oder neu zu veröffentlichen, ganz oder teilweise, als Bestandteil eines anderen Dokuments.\nEine MMC ist “geeignet zur Relizenzierung”, wenn sie unter dieser Lizenz lizenziert wird, und wenn alle Werke, die zuerst unter dieser Lizenz irgendwo anders als auf der MMC veröffentlicht, und nachträglich ganz oder teilweise in der MMC einbezogen wurden, (1) keine Umschlagtexte oder unveränderliche Abschnitte hatten, und (2) folglich vor dem 1. November 2008 einbezogen wurden.\nBetreiber eines MMC-Standortes kann eine MMC, enthalten im Standort unter CC-BY-SA des gleichen Standortes, jederzeit vor dem 1. August 2009 neu veröffentlichen, vorausgesetzt, die MMC ist für die Relizenzierung geeignet.\nAnhang: Wie Sie diese Lizenz für Ihre Dokumente verwenden\nUm diese Lizenz in einem Dokument, das Sie geschrieben haben, zu verwenden, nehmen Sie eine Kopie der Lizenz in das Dokument auf und setzen Sie die folgenden Urheberrechts- und Lizenzhinweise unmittelbar hinter das Titelblatt:\n\nCopyright © JAHR IHR NAME. Es wird die Erlaubnis gewährt, dieses Dokument zu kopieren, zu verteilen und/oder zu modifizieren, unter den Bestimmungen der GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 oder jeder späteren Version, veröffentlicht von der Free Software Foundation; ohne unveränderliche Abschnitte, ohne vordere Umschlagtexte und ohne hintere Umschlagtexte. Eine Kopie der Lizenz wird im Abschnitt mit dem Titel ‘GNU Free Documentation License’ bereitgestellt.\nWenn Sie unveränderliche Abschnitte, vordere Umschlagtexte und hintere Umschlagtexte haben, ersetzen Sie die Zeile ‘ohne ...Umschlagtexte.’ durch diese:\nmit den unveränderlichen Abschnitten AUFGELISTET NACH TITELN, mit den vorderen Umschlagtexten AUFGELISTET und mit den hinteren Umschlagtexten AUFGELISTET.\nWenn Sie unveränderliche Abschnitte ohne Umschlagtexte haben oder eine andere Kombination der drei, vermischen Sie jene zwei Alternativen zu einer übereinstimmenden Situation.\n\nWenn Ihr Dokument nicht-triviale Beispiele eines Programmcodes enthält, empfehlen wir, diese Beispiele entsprechend unter einer freien Software-Lizenz ihrer Wahl, wie der GNU General Public License freizugeben, um deren Verwendung in freier Software zu gestatten.\n"}}}
