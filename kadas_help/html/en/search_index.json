Albireo is based on the professional open source GIS software \"QGIS\". In cooperation with Ergnomen, a user interface tailored to the application has been created. On the one hand, many unnecessary geodata processing functions have been omitted, on the other hand, there are areas such as terrain analysis, where a greatly expanded range of functions is available.\nTerms of Use\nKADAS Albireo is under the General Public License 2.0 (GPLv2).\nThe MSS / MilX component is the property of gs-soft AG.\nThe terms of use for the data are listed in the application under Help → About.\nSystem requirements\n\nWindows 7 or later, 64bit\n\nOpenGL capable graphics card\n\n10 GB of storage space for application and basic data set package\n\n\nChangelog\nVersion 1.1 (November 2017)\n\nGeneral:\nFreely positionable cursor in the search field\nHeight display in the status bar\nSpeed ​​improvements in map display\nAttribute table for vector layers\n\n\n\nAnalysis *:\nGeodetic distance and area measurement\nOption to measure azimuth relative to the map north or geographical north\n\n\n\n\nDraw:\nOptional snapping when drawing\nUndo/redo when drawing\nDrawings can be moved, copied, cut and pasted, individually or as a group\nExisting geometries can be continued\nLoading of SVG graphics (including SymTaZ graphics)\nLoading non-georeferenced images\nPictures and pins are now stored in corresponding layers\n\n\nMSS:\nUpgrade to MSS-2018\nCorrect size ratio of MSS symbols when printing\nCartouche content can be imported or exported to and from MilX or XML files\nNumeric input of attributes when drawing MSS symbols\n\n\n3D:\nSupport for 3D geometries in the 3D view\n\n\nPrinting:\nPrint templates contained in the project can be managed\n\n\n\nVersion 1.0 (September 2016)\n\nInitial version\n\n"},"qgis_gui.html":{"url":"qgis_gui.html","title":"Application interface and project management","keywords":"","body":"Application interface and project management\n\nThe application window\nThe application window is divided into the following areas:\n\nMenu Bar: Here you can switch between the functionality tabs.\n\nFunctionality tabs: Here the functionalities can be activated.\n\nFavorites: Functions can be placed here by drag-and-drop.\n\nMap window: Here the map is displayed.\n\nGeodata-Toolbar: Here you can add local geodata to the map, reload the geo-data catalog, as well as perform the authentication for the access to protected geodata.\n\nGeodatenkatalog: Here layers from Web services are listed. Layers can be added via drag-and-drop or double-click.\n\nLayertree: Here you can manage the layers of the currently loaded map.\n\nStatus Bar: Displays the current mouse position in the map, allows changing the map scale as well as the display and projection coordinate reference systems, as well as activating a connected GPS receiver.\n\nSearch box: Here you can search for locations, addresses, coordinates and in layers.\n\nMap context menu: Functions are offered for the selected element depending on the context, as well as quick access to important functions also found in the functionality tabs.\n\n\nNavigation in the map and map tools\nPanning in the map is done with the left or middle mouse button, zooming with the scroll wheel or with the zoom buttons in the upper right corner of the map window. The right mouse button opens the context menu. Pan and rotation gestures are recognized on touch-enabled devices. In addition, you can zoom to a specific extent by holding down the SHIFT key and dragging a rectangle.\nIf no map tool is active, you are automatically in navigation mode. If a tool (for example, measuring or drawing) is active, the button in the corresponding tab of the tool is highlighted. A tool can be deactivated again by pressing the corresponding button again, or alternatively by pressing the ESC key.\nRegardless of the active map tool, the middle mouse button and the scroll wheel are always used for map navigation. The function of the left mouse button depends on the active tool.\nThe functions Previous Extent and Next Extent in the View tab can be used to return to previously or later viewed map extents.\nGrid\nThe map grid can be activated in the View tab. The grid is based on the chosen map coordinate system.\nProjects\nMaps can be loaded and saved as projects. The QGIS project format is used, ending with *.qgs. Projects are created from templates. When starting the application, a project is automatically created from an online or offline template, depending on whether the computer is connected to the network. The functions New, Open, Save and Save as allow creating new projects (from a template), opening existing projects and saving open projects.\nCertain tools generate datasets that are placed in the folder _files. When sharing the project, this folder should be distributed together with the project file. Other local datasets that need to be exchanged should also be placed in this directory and added to the map from there, otherwise the path will be stored in the project as an absolute path which may not exist on other systems.\nData sources\nThe main data source is the geodata catalog.

During measurement, relevant measurement values ​​are displayed directly next to the measurement geometry. For distance, surfaces and circles, several measurement geometries can be drawn one after the other. The measurement total is displayed at the bottom of the map window, where the measuring unit can also be changed. Furthermore, an existing geometry can be measured by means of the picker button.\n\nTerrain analysis functions\nTo use the terrain analysis functions, a height model must be defined in the current project. A raster layer can be selected as height model in its context menu in the map layer tree.\nThe Profile / View tool allows the measurement of height profiles. If the measurement line consists of a single segment, a line of sight can be performed along it. Visible or invisible areas are then drawn accordingly green or red. If you move the mouse along the measurement line, the corresponding position in the height profile is displayed with a blue dot. The visibility analysis takes into account the curvature of the earth.\n\nThe Slope and Hillshade tools calculate slope and shading profile of the terrain in a selected rectangular cutout.\nThe visibility tool calculates the visible or invisible terrain area in a circular sector, starting from the center of the circle - the observer location. The visibility analysis takes into account the curvature of the earth.\nThe results of the slope, hillshade, and visibility analyzes are added to the map as raster layers, and appear accordingly in the map layer tree.

The application Franson GPS-Gate Splitter can generate a virtual COM interface for many GPS devices through which KADAS can receive NMEA data.\nIn KADAS, the connection with a GPS device is made via the toggleable icon in the status bar or via the corresponding button in the GPS tab. The icon in the status bar indicates the status of the connection. If the connection is successful, a position marker is displayed in the map. If the function Move with GPS is active, the map extent automatically moves with the GPS position.\nGPS routes\nGPX (GPX Exchange Format) is a standard for exchanging GPS data between devices and applications. It describes waypoints, routes and tracks.\nKADAS provides functions for creating, editing and exporting GPS routes.\nImported routes or those created via Draw Waypoints and Draw Routes are stored in the GPS routes layer. Waypoints are represented as point geometries, routes and tracks as line geometries.

After an icon has been selected in the gallery, it can be placed on the map.\nSymbols are stored in MilX layers. These are visible in the map layer tree. In the symbol gallery new MilX layers can be created as well specified to which layer newly drawn symbols are added.\n\nAlready drawn symbols can be subsequently edited by selecting them on the map. Selected objects can be moved and, depending on the symbol type, nodes can be moved individually or created or removed via the context menu. The MilX symbol editor can be opened by double-clicking or editing the context menu.\nSimilar to redlining objects, MSS symbols can be moved, copied, cut and pasted individually or as a group. In addition to the entries in the context menu and the usual keyboard shortcuts, there are also the Copy to... and Move to... buttons at the bottom of the map frame. The latter allow to explicitly specify a target layer, otherwise the currently selected MilX layer is taken as the target layer. If no MilX layer is selected, the user will be asked to specify the destination layer.\n\nMilX layers can be marked as approved in the map content context menu. Approved layers can not be edited.\nExchanging MilX layers\nMilX layers can be imported and exported from MILXLY files. MILXLY (and the compressed variant MILXLYZ) is a format for the exchange of situation reports. It contains only MSS symbols of the situation report, and no further objects like redlining, pins or camera pictures.\nWhen exporting to MILXLY(Z) you can select which MilX layers to export and in which version the file should be created. In addition, you can choose whether to export the map cartouche defined in the print dialog.\nImporting a MILXLY(Z) file imports all the layers it contains. If the MSS file contains symbol definitions according to an older standard, these are automatically converted. Possible conversion losses or errors are communicated to the user. If one of the imported layers contains a cartouche, the user will be asked if they should be imported into KADAS.\nOVL import\nOVL is the project format of the software PCMAP Swissline. Only OVL version 5.0 is supported. Older files should be upgraded with the PCMAP Swissline software before they are imported into KADAS.\nThe OVL Importer converts tactical graphics contained within it into corresponding MSS symbols, while transforming geometries and labels into redlining objects. If conversion errors occur, they will be communicated to the user.

By default, layouts for A0 through A6 are available in both landscape and portrait modes, as well as a Custom layout.\nIt should be noted that the layouts are project specific, so the layouts offered may differ from project to project.\nWhen the layout is selected, the main map window displays a blue semi-transparent rectangle that corresponds to the section to be printed. For fixed-size layouts, this rectangle can be moved in the main map to adjust the print area. The size of the rectangle is derived from the paper size and the scale specified in the print dialog. In the case of the Custom layout, the section is numerically defined along with the scale in the print dialog, and the resulting paper size is dynamically calculated according to this information.\nWhen printing additional elements, coordinate grid, card cartridge, legend, and scale bar can be shown or hidden as desired. The position of these elements is defined in the layout.\nThe advanced mode offers additional configuration options, including the possibly to change the arrangement of the elements.\nThe print composition can be exported as a file or sent to a printer.\n\nThe print layouts contained in the project can be managed in the Print Layout Manager dialog, which can be opened by pressing the button to the right of the print layout selection.

It also allows the user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly (OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All of these features allow the user to display layers with different CRSs and have them overlay properly.\nOverview of Projection Support \nKADAS has support for approximately 2,700 known CRSs. Definitions for each CRS are stored in a SQLite database that is installed with KADAS. Normally, you do not need to manipulate the database directly. In fact, doing so may cause projection support to fail. Custom CRSs are stored in a user database. See section sec_custom_projections for information on managing your custom coordinate reference systems.\nThe CRSs available in KADAS are based on those defined by the European Petroleum Search Group (EPSG) and the Institut Geographique National de France (IGNF) and are largely abstracted from the spatial reference tables used in GDAL. EPSG identifiers are present in the database and can be used to specify a CRS in KADAS.\nIn order to use OTF projection, either your data must contain information about its coordinate reference system or you will need to define a global, layer or project-wide CRS. For PostGIS layers, KADAS uses the spatial reference identifier that was specified when the layer was created. For data supported by OGR, KADAS relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the CRS. In the case of shapefiles, this means a file containing the well-known text (WKT) specification of the CRS. This projection file has the same base name as the shapefile and a .prj extension. For example, a shapefile named alaska.shp would have a corresponding projection file named alaska.prj.\nThe CRS tab contains the following important components:\n\nFilter — If you know the EPSG code, the identifier, or the name for a coordinate reference system, you can use the search feature to find it. Enter the EPSG code, the identifier or the name.\nRecently used coordinate reference systems — If you have certain CRSs that you frequently use in your everyday GIS work, these will be displayed in this list. Click on one of these items to select the associated CRS.\nCoordinate reference systems of the world — This is a list of all CRSs supported by KADAS, including Geographic, Projected and Custom coordinate reference systems. To define a CRS, select it from the list by expanding the appropriate node and selecting the CRS. The active CRS is preselected.\nPROJ.4 text — This is the CRS string used by the PROJ.4 projection engine. This text is read-only and provided for informational purposes.\n\nDefault datum transformations \nOTF depends on being able to transform data into a ‘default CRS’, and KADAS uses WGS84. For some CRS there are a number of transforms available. KADAS allows you to define the transformation used otherwise KADAS uses a default transformation.\nKADAS asks which transformation to use by opening a dialogue box displaying PROJ.4 text describing the source and destination transforms. Further information may be found by hovering over a transform. User defaults can be saved by selecting  Remember selection.\n"},"print_composer/print_composer.html":{"url":"print_composer/print_composer.html","title":"Print Composer","keywords":"","body":"Print Composer \nWith the Print Composer you can create nice maps and atlasses that can be printed or saved as PDF-file, an image or an SVG-file.

The toolbar can be switched off and on using the right mouse button over the toolbar.\nOverview of the Print Composer \nOpening the Print Composer provides you with a blank canvas that represents the paper surface when using the print option. Initially you find buttons on the left beside the canvas to add map composer items; the current KADAS map canvas, text labels, images, legends, scale bars, basic shapes, arrows, attribute tables and HTML frames. In this toolbar you also find toolbar buttons to navigate, zoom in on an area and pan the view on the composer and toolbar buttons to select a map composer item and to move the contents of the map item.\nFigure_composer_overview shows the initial view of the Print Composer before any elements are added.\nFigure Composer Overview:\n\nPrint Composer \nOn the right beside the canvas you find two panels. The upper panel holds the tabs Items and Command History and the lower panel holds the tabs Composition, Item properties and Atlas generation.\n\nThe Items tab provides a list of all map composer items added to the canvas.\nThe Command history tab displays a history of all changes applied to the Print Composer layout. With a mouse click, it is possible to undo and redo layout steps back and forth to a certain status.\nThe Composition tab allows you to set paper size, orientation, the page background, number of pages and print quality for the output file in dpi. Furthermore, you can also activate the  Print as raster checkbox. This means all items will be converted to raster before printing or saving as PostScript or PDF. In this tab, you can also customize settings for grid and smart guides.\nThe Item Properties tab displays the properties for the selected item. Click the  Select/Move\\ item icon to select an item (e.g., legend, scale bar or label) on the canvas. Then click the Item Properties tab and customize the settings for the selected item.\nThe Atlas generation tab allows you to enable the generation of an atlas for the current Composer and gives access to its parameters.\nFinally, you can save your print composition with the  Save\\ Project button.\n\nIn the bottom part of the Print Composer window, you can find a status bar with mouse position, current page number and a combo box to set the zoom level.\nYou can add multiple elements to the Composer. It is also possible to have more than one map view or legend or scale bar in the Print Composer canvas, on one or several pages. Each element has its own properties and, in the case of the map, its own extent. If you want to remove any elements from the Composer canvas you can do that with the Delete or the Backspace key.\nNavigation tools \nTo navigate in the canvas layout, the Print Composer provides some general tools:\n\n Zoom\\ in\n Zoom\\ out\n Zoom\\ full\n Zoom\\ to\\ 100%\n Refresh\\ view (if you find the view in an inconsistent state)\n Pan\\ composer\n Zoom (zoom to a specific region of the Composer)\n\nYou can change the zoom level also using the mouse wheel or the combo box in the status bar. If you need to switch to pan mode while working in the Composer area, you can hold the Spacebar or the the mouse wheel. With Ctrl+Spacebar, you can temporarily switch to zoom mode, and with Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar, to zoom out mode.\nSample Session \nTo demonstrate how to create a map please follow the next instructions.\n\nOn the left site, select the  Add\\ new\\ map toolbar button and draw a rectangle on the canvas holding down the left mouse button.

Inside the drawn rectangle the legend will be drawn.\nSelect the  Select/Move\\ item icon to select the map on the canvas and move it a bit.\nWhile the map item is still selected you can also change the size of the map item. Click while holding down the left mouse button, in a white little rectangle in one of the corners of the map item and drag it to a new location to change it’s size.\nClick the Item Properties tab on the left lower panel and find the setting for the orientation. Change the value of the setting Map orientation to ‘15.00° ‘. You should see the orientation of the map item change.\nFinally, you can save your print composition with the  Save\\ Project button.\n\nPrint Composer Options \nFrom Settings ‣ Composer Options you can set some options that will be used as default during your work.\n\nCompositions defaults let you specify the default font to use.\nWith Grid appearance, you can set the grid style and its color. There are three types of grid: Dots, Solid lines and Crosses.\nGrid and guide defaults defines spacing, offset and tolerance of the grid.\n\nComposition tab — General composition setup \nIn the Composition tab, you can define the global settings of your composition.\n\nYou can choose one of the Presets for your paper sheet, or enter your custom width and height.\nComposition can now be divided into several pages. For instance, a first page can show a map canvas, and a second page can show the attribute table associated with a layer, while a third one shows an HTML frame linking to your organization website. Set the Number of pages to the desired value. You can choose the page Orientation and its Exported resolution. When checked,  print as raster means all elements will be rasterized before printing or saving as PostScript or PDF.\nGrid and guides lets you customize grid settings like spacings, offsets and tolerance to your need. The tolerance is the maximum distance below which an item is snapped to smart guides.\n\nSnap to grid and/or to smart guides can be enabled from the View menu. In this menu, you can also hide or show the grid and smart guides.\nComposer items common options \nComposer items have a set of common properties you will find on the bottom of the Item Properties tab: Position and size, Rotation, Frame, Background, Item ID and Rendering (See figure_composer_common_1).\nFigure Composer Common 1:\n\nCommon Item properties Dialogs \n\nThe Position and size dialog lets you define size and position of the frame that contains the item. You can also choose which Reference point will be set at the X and Y coordinates previously defined.\nThe Rotation sets the rotation of the element (in degrees).\nThe  Frame shows or hides the frame around the label. Use the Frame color and Thickness menus to adjust those properties.\nUse the Background color menu for setting a background color. With the dialog you can pick a color (see Color Picker ).\nUse the Item ID to create a relationship to other Print Composer items. This is used with KADAS server and any potential web client. You can set an ID on an item (e.g., a map and a label), and then the web client can send data to set a property (e.g., label text) for that specific item. The GetProjectSettings command will list what items and which IDs are available in a layout.\nRendering mode can be selected in the option field. See Rendering_Mode.\n\nNote\n\nThe  Data\\ defined\\ override icon next to a field means that you can associate the field with data in the map item or use expressions. These are particularly helpful with atlas generation (See atlas_data_defined_overrides).\n\nKADAS now allows advanced rendering for Composer items just like vector and raster layers.\nFigure Composer common 2:\n\nRendering mode \n\nTransparency : You can make the underlying item in the Composer visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your item to your needs. You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the menu beside the slider.\n\n Exclude item from exports: You can decide to make an item not visible in all exports. After activating this checkbox, the item will not be included in PDF’s, prints etc..\n\nBlending mode: You can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you previously only may know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying items are mixed through the settings described below.\n\n\nNormal: This is the standard blend mode, which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the pixel beneath it; the colors aren’t mixed.\nLighten: This selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nScreen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer (e.g., you can use a hillshade to texture another layer).\nDodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So, brighter top pixels cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top pixels aren’t too bright; otherwise the effect is too extreme.\nAddition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with pixel values of the other. In case of values above 1 (as in the case of RGB), white is displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.\nDarken: This creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nMultiply: Here, the numbers for each pixel of the top layer are multiplied with the numbers for the corresponding pixel of the bottom layer. The results are darker pictures.\nBurn: Darker colors in the top layer cause the underlying layers to darken. Burn can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.\nOverlay: This mode combines the multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture, light parts become lighter and dark parts become darker.\nSoft light: This is very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This mode is supposed to emulate shining a soft light onto an image.\nHard light: Hard light is very similar to the overlay mode. It’s supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.\nDifference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel, or the other way around, to always get a positive value. Blending with black produces no change, as the difference with all colors is zero.\nSubtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer with pixel values of the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.\n\nThe Map item \n\n\n\nClick on the  Add\\ new\\ map toolbar button in the Print Composer toolbar to add the KADAS map canvas. Now, drag a rectangle onto the Composer canvas with the left mouse button to add the map. To display the current map, you can choose between three different modes in the map Item Properties tab:\n\nRectangle is the default setting. It only displays an empty box with a message ‘Map will be printed here’.\nCache renders the map in the current screen resolution. If you zoom the Composer window in or out, the map is not rendered again but the image will be scaled.\nRender means that if you zoom the Composer window in or out, the map will be rendered again, but for space reasons, only up to a maximum resolution.\n\nCache is the default preview mode for newly added Print Composer maps.\nYou can resize the map element by clicking on the  Select/Move\\ item button, selecting the element, and dragging one of the blue handles in the corner of the map. With the map selected, you can now adapt more properties in the map Item Properties tab.\nTo move layers within the map element, select the map element, click the  Move\\ item\\ content icon and move the layers within the map item frame with the left mouse button. After you have found the right place for an item, you can lock the item position within the Print Composer canvas. Select the map item and use the toolbar  Lock\\ Selected\\ Items or the Items tab to Lock the item. A locked item can only be selected using the Items tab. Once selected you can use the Items tab to unlock individual items. The Unlock\\ All\\ Items icon will unlock all locked composer items.\nMain properties \nThe Main properties dialog of the map Item Properties tab provides the following functionalities (see figure_composer_map_1):\nFigure Composer Map 1:\n\nMap Item properties Tab \n\nThe Preview area allows you to define the preview modes ‘Rectangle’, ‘Cache’ and ‘Render’, as described above. If you change the view on the KADAS map canvas by changing vector or raster properties, you can update the Print Composer view by selecting the map element in the Print Composer and clicking the [Update preview] button.\nThe field Scale  sets a manual scale.\nThe field Map rotation  allows you to rotate the map element content clockwise in degrees. The rotation of the map view can be imitated here. Note that a correct coordinate frame can only be added with the default value 0 and that once you defined a Map rotation it currently cannot be changed.\n Draw map canvas items lets you show annotations that may be placed on the map canvas in the main KADAS window.\nYou can choose to lock the layers shown on a map item. Check  Lock layers for map item. After this is checked, any layer that would be displayed or hidden in the main KADAS window will not appear or be hidden in the map item of the Composer. But style and labels of a locked layer are still refreshed according to the main KADAS interface. You can prevent this by using Lock layer styles for map item.\nThe  button allows you to add quickly all the presets views you have prepared in QGIS.

You can then resize/move this group just like a single item.\nOnce you have found the correct position for an item, you can lock it by using the items on the toolbar or ticking the box next to the item in the Items tab. Locked items are not selectable on the canvas.\nLocked items can be unlocked by selecting the item in the Items tab and unchecking the tickbox or you can use the icons on the toolbar.\nTo unselect an item, just click on it holding the Shift button.\nInside the Edit menu, you can find actions to select all the items, to clear all selections or to invert the current selection.\nAlignment \nRaising or lowering functionalities for elements are inside the  Raise\\ selected\\ items pull-down menu. Choose an element on the Print Composer canvas and select the matching functionality to raise or lower the selected element compared to the other elements (see table_composer_1). This order is shown in the Items tab. You can also raise or lower objects in the Items tab by clicking and dragging an object’s label in this list.\nFigure Composer 28:\n\nAlignment helper lines in the Print Composer \nThere are several alignment functionalities available within the  Align\\ selected\\ items pull-down menu (see table_composer_1). To use an alignment functionality, you first select some elements and then click on the matching alignment icon. All selected elements will then be aligned within to their common bounding box. When moving items on the Composer canvas, alignment helper lines appear when borders, centers or corners are aligned.\nCopy/Cut and Paste items \nThe print composer includes actions to use the common Copy/Cut/Paste functionality for the items in the layout. As usual first you need to select the items using one of the options seen above; at this point the actions can be found in the Edit menu. When using the Paste action, the elements will be pasted according to the current mouse position.\nNote\nHTML items can not be copied in this way. As a workaround, use the [Add Frame] button in the Item Properties tab.\nDuring the layout process, it is possible to revert and restore changes. This can be done with the revert and restore tools:\n\n Revert\\ last\\ change\n Restore\\ last\\ change\n\nThis can also be done by mouse click within the Command history tab (see figure_composer_29).\nFigure Composer 29:\n\nCommand history in the Print Composer \nThe Print Composer includes generation functions that allow you to create map books in an automated way. The concept is to use a coverage layer, which contains geometries and fields. For each geometry in the coverage layer, a new output will be generated where the content of some canvas maps will be moved to highlight the current geometry. Fields associated with this geometry can be used within text labels.\nEvery page will be generated with each feature. To enable the generation of an atlas and access generation parameters, refer to the Atlas generation tab. This tab contains the following widgets (see Figure_composer_atlas):\nFigure Composer Atlas:\n\nAtlas generation tab \n\n Generate an atlas, which enables or disables the atlas generation.\nA Coverage layer  combo box that allows you to choose the (vector) layer containing the geometries on which to iterate over.\nAn optional  Hidden coverage layer that, if checked, will hide the coverage layer (but not the other ones) during the generation.\nAn optional Filter with text area that allows you to specify an expression for filtering features from the coverage layer. If the expression is not empty, only features that evaluate to True will be selected. The button on the right allows you to display the expression builder.\nAn Output filename expression textbox that is used to generate a filename for each geometry if needed. It is based on expressions. This field is meaningful only for rendering to multiple files.\nA  Single file export when possible that allows you to force the generation of a single file if this is possible with the chosen output format (PDF, for instance). If this field is checked, the value of the Output filename expression field is meaningless.\nAn optional  Sort by that, if checked, allows you to sort features of the coverage layer. The associated combo box allows you to choose which column will be used as the sorting key. Sort order (either ascending or descending) is set by a two-state button that displays an up or a down arrow.\n\nYou can use multiple map items with the atlas generation; each map will be rendered according to the coverage features. To enable atlas generation for a specific map item, you need to check Controlled by Atlas under the item properties of the map item. Once checked, you can set:\n\nA radiobutton  Margin around feature that allows you to select the amount of space added around each geometry within the allocated map. Its value is meaningful only when using the auto-scaling mode.\nA  Predefined scale (best fit). It will use the best fitting option from the list of predefined scales in your project properties settings (see Project –> Project Properties –> General –> Project Scales to configure these predefined scales).\nA  Fixed scale that allows you to toggle between auto-scale and fixed-scale mode. In fixed-scale mode, the map will only be translated for each geometry to be centered. In auto-scale mode, the map’s extents are computed in such a way that each geometry will appear in its entirety.\n\nLabels \nIn order to adapt labels to the feature the atlas plugin iterates over, you can include expressions. For example, for a city layer with fields CITY_NAME and ZIPCODE, you could insert this:\nThe area of [% upper(CITY_NAME) || ',' || ZIPCODE || ' is ' format_number($area/1000000,2) %] km2\nThe information [% upper(CITY_NAME) || ‘,’ || ZIPCODE || ‘ is ‘ format_number($area/1000000,2) %] is an expression used inside the label. That would result in the generated atlas as:\nThe area of PARIS,75001 is 1.94 km2\nData Defined Override Buttons \nThere are several places where you can use a  Data\\ Defined\\ Override button to override the selected setting. These options are particularly usefull with Atlas Generation.\nFor the following examples the Regions layer of the KADAS sample dataset is used and selected for Atlas Generation. We also assume the paper format A4 (210X297) is selected in the Composition tab for field Presets.\nWith a Data Defined Override button you can dynamically set the paper orientation. When the height (north-south) of the extents of a region is greater than it’s width (east-west), you rather want to use portrait instead of landscape orientation to optimize the use of paper.\nIn the Composition you can set the field Orientation and select Landscape or Portrait. We want to set the orientation dynamically using an expression depending on the region geometry. press the  button of field Orientation, select Edit ... so the Expression string builder dialog opens. Give following expression:\nCASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 'Landscape' ELSE 'Portrait' END\nNow the paper orients itself automatically for each Region you need to reposition the location of the composer item as well. For the map item you can use the  button of field Width to set it dynamically using following expression:\n(CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) - 20\nUse the  button of field Heigth to provide following expression:\n(CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 210 ELSE 297 END) - 20\nWhen you want to give a title above map in the center of the page, insert a label item above the map. First use the item properties of the label item to set the horizontal alignment to  Center. Next activate from Reference point the upper middle checkbox. You can provide following expression for field X :\n(CASE WHEN bounds_width($atlasgeometry) > bounds_height($atlasgeometry) THEN 297 ELSE 210 END) / 2\nFor all other composer items you can set the position in a similar way so they are correctly positioned when page is automatically rotated in portrait or landscape.\nInformation provided is derived from the excellent blog (in english and portugese) on the Data Defined Override options Multiple_format_map_series_using_QGIS_2.6_ .\nThis is just one example of how you can use Data Defined Overrides.\nPreview \nOnce the atlas settings have been configured and map items selected, you can create a preview of all the pages by clicking on Atlas ‣ Preview Atlas and using the arrows, in the same menu, to navigate through all the features.\nGeneration \nThe atlas generation can be done in different ways. For example, with Atlas ‣ Print Atlas, you can directly print it. You can also create a PDF using Atlas ‣ Export Atlas as PDF: The user will be asked for a directory for saving all the generated PDF files (except if the  Single file export when possible has been selected). If you need to print just a page of the atlas, simply start the preview function, select the page you need and click on Composer ‣ Print (or create a PDF).\nTo maximise the space available to interact with a composition you can use View –>  Hide panels or press F10.\n:: note:\nIt's also possible to switch to a full screen mode to have more space to interact by pressing\n:kbd:`F11` or using :guilabel:`View --> |checkbox| :guilabel:`Toggle full screen`.\nFigure_composer_output shows the Print Composer with an example print layout, including each type of map item described in the sections above.\nFigure Composer Output:\n\nPrint Composer with map view, legend, image, scale bar, coordinates, text and HTML frame added \nBefore printing a layout you have the possibility to view your composition without bounding boxes. This can be enabled by deactivating View –>  Show bounding boxes or pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B.\nThe Print Composer allows you to create several output formats, and it is possible to define the resolution (print quality) and paper size:\n\nThe  Print icon allows you to print the layout to a connected printer or a PostScript file, depending on installed printer drivers.\nThe  Export\\ as\\ image icon exports the Composer canvas in several image formats, such as PNG, BPM, TIF, JPG,...\n Export\\ as\\ PDF saves the defined Print Composer canvas directly as a PDF.\nThe  Export\\ as\\ SVG icon saves the Print Composer canvas as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic).\n\nIf you need to export your layout as a georeferenced image (i.e., to load back inside KADAS), you need to enable this feature under the Composition tab. Check  World file on and choose the map item to use. With this option, the ‘Export as image’ action will also create a world file.\nNote\n\nCurrently, the SVG output is very basic. This is not a KADAS problem, but a problem with the underlying Qt library. This will hopefully be sorted out in future versions.\nExporting big rasters can sometimes fail, even if there seems to be enough memory. This is also a problem with the underlying Qt management of rasters.\n\n"},"working_with_vector/supported_data.html":{"url":"working_with_vector/supported_data.html","title":"Working with Vector Data","keywords":"","body":"Supported Data Formats \nKADAS uses the OGR library to read and write vector data formats, including ESRI shapefiles, MapInfo and MicroStation file formats, AutoCAD DXF, PostGIS, SpatiaLite, Oracle Spatial and MSSQL Spatial databases, and many more. GRASS vector and PostgreSQL support is supplied by native KADAS data provider plugins. Vector data can also be loaded in read mode from zip and gzip archives into KADAS. As of the date of this document, 69 vector formats are supported by the OGR library (see OGR-SOFTWARE-SUITE in literature_and_web). The complete list is available at http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html.\nESRI Shapefiles \nThe standard vector file format used in KADAS is the ESRI shapefile. Support is provided by the OGR Simple Feature Library (http://www.gdal.org/ogr/).\nA shapefile actually consists of several files. The following three are required:\n\n.shp file containing the feature geometries\n.dbf file containing the attributes in dBase format\n.shx index file\n\nShapefiles also can include a file with a .prj suffix, which contains the projection information. While it is very useful to have a projection file, it is not mandatory. A shapefile dataset can contain additional files. For further details, see the ESRI technical specification at http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf.\nLoading a Shapefile \nWhen loading a vector layer, the following dialog opens:\nFigure Vector 1:\n\nAdd Vector Layer Dialog \nFrom the available options check  File. Click on [Browse]. That will bring up a standard open file dialog (see figure_vector_2), which allows you to navigate the file system and load a shapefile or other supported data source. The selection box Filter  allows you to preselect some OGR-supported file formats.\nYou can also select the encoding for the shapefile if desired.\nFigure Vector 2:\n\nOpen an OGR Supported Vector Layer Dialog \nSelecting a shapefile from the list and clicking [Open] loads it into KADAS.\nTip\nLayer Colors\nWhen you add a layer to the map, it is assigned a random color. When adding more than one layer at a time, different colors are assigned to each layer.\nOnce a shapefile is loaded, you can zoom around it using the map navigation tools. To change the style of a layer, open the Layer Properties dialog by double clicking on the layer name or by right-clicking on the name in the legend and choosing Properties from the context menu. See section Style Menu for more information on setting symbology of vector layers.\nImproving Performance for Shapefiles \nTo improve the performance of drawing a shapefile, you can create a spatial index. A spatial index will improve the speed of both zooming and panning. Spatial indexes used by KADAS have a .qix extension.\nUse these steps to create the index:\n\nLoad a shapefile by clicking on the  Add\\ Vector\\ Layer toolbar button or pressing Ctrl+Shift+V.\nOpen the Layer Properties dialog by double-clicking on the shapefile name in the legend or by right-clicking and choosing Properties from the context menu.\nIn the General tab, click the [Create Spatial Index] button.\n\nProblem loading a shape .prj file \nIf you load a shapefile with a .prj file and KADAS is not able to read the coordinate reference system from that file, you will need to define the proper projection manually within the General tab of the Layer Properties dialog of the layer by clicking the [Specify...] button. This is due to the fact that .prj files often do not provide the complete projection parameters as used in KADAS and listed in the CRS dialog.\nFor the same reason, if you create a new shapefile with KADAS, two different projection files are created: a .prj file with limited projection parameters, compatible with ESRI software, and a .qpj file, providing the complete parameters of the used CRS. Whenever KADAS finds a .qpj file, it will be used instead of the .prj.\nLoading a MapInfo Layer \n To load a MapInfo layer, change the file type filter Files of type : to ‘Mapinfo File [OGR] (*.mif *.tab *.MIF *.TAB)’ and select the MapInfo layer you want to load.\nLoading an ArcInfo Binary Coverage \n To load an ArcInfo Binary Coverage, select  Directory as Source type. Change the file type filter Files of type  to ‘Arc/Info Binary Coverage’. Navigate to the directory that contains the coverage file, and select it.\nSimilarly, you can load directory-based vector files in the UK National Transfer Format, as well as the raw TIGER Format of the US Census Bureau.\n"},"working_with_vector/vector_properties.html":{"url":"working_with_vector/vector_properties.html","title":"The Vector Properties Dialog","keywords":"","body":"The Vector Properties Dialog \nThe Layer Properties dialog for a vector layer provides information about the layer, symbology settings and labeling options. If your vector layer has been loaded from a PostgreSQL/PostGIS datastore, you can also alter the underlying SQL for the layer by invoking the Query Builder dialog on the General tab. To access the Layer Properties dialog, double-click on a layer in the legend or right-click on the layer and select Properties from the pop-up menu.\nFigure Vector Properties 1:\n\nVector Layer Properties Dialog \nStyle Menu \nThe Style menu provides you with a comprehensive tool for rendering and symbolizing your vector data. You can use Layer rendering ‣ tools that are common to all vector data, as well as special symbolizing tools that were designed for the different kinds of vector data.\nRenderers \nThe renderer is responsible for drawing a feature together with the correct symbol. There are four types of renderers: single symbol, categorized, graduated and rule-based. There is no continuous color renderer, because it is in fact only a special case of the graduated renderer. The categorized and graduated renderers can be created by specifying a symbol and a color ramp - they will set the colors for symbols appropriately. For point layers, there is a point displacement renderer available. For each data type (points, lines and polygons), vector symbol layer types are available. Depending on the chosen renderer, the Style menu provides different additional sections. On the bottom right of the symbology dialog, there is a [Symbol] button, which gives access to the Style Manager (see vector_style_manager). The Style Manager allows you to edit and remove existing symbols and add new ones.\nAfter having made any needed changes, the symbol can be added to the list of current style symbols (using [Symbol]  Save in symbol library), and then it can easily be used in the future. Furthermore, you can use the [Save Style]  button to save the symbol as a KADAS layer style file (.qml) or SLD file (.sld). SLDs can be exported from any type of renderer – single symbol, categorized, graduated or rule-based – but when importing an SLD, either a single symbol or rule-based renderer is created. That means that categorized or graduated styles are converted to rule-based. If you want to preserve those renderers, you have to stick to the QML format. On the other hand, it can be very handy sometimes to have this easy way of converting styles to rule-based.\nIf you change the renderer type when setting the style of a vector layer the settings you made for the symbol will be maintained. Be aware that this procedure only works for one change. If you repeat changing the renderer type the settings for the symbol will get lost.\nIf the datasource of the layer is a database (PostGIS or Spatialite for example), you can save your layer style inside a table of the database. Just click on Save Style comboxbox and choose Save in database item then fill in the dialog to define a style name, add a description, an ui file and if the style is a default style. When loading a layer from the database, if a style already exists for this layer, KADAS will load the layer and its style. You can add several style in the database. Only one will be the default style anyway.\nFigure Vector Properties 2:\n\nSave Style in database Dialog \nTip\nSelect and change multiple symbols\nThe Symbology allows you to select multiple symbols and right click to change color, transparency, size, or width of selected entries.\nSingle Symbol Renderer\nThe Single Symbol Renderer is used to render all features of the layer using a single user-defined symbol. The properties, which can be adjusted in the Style menu, depend partially on the type of layer, but all types share the following dialog structure. In the top-left part of the menu, there is a preview of the current symbol to be rendered. On the right part of the menu, there is a list of symbols already defined for the current style, prepared to be used by selecting them from the list. The current symbol can be modified using the menu on the right side.\nIf you click on the first level in the Symbol layers dialog on the left side, it’s possible to define basic parameters like Size, Transparency, color and Rotation. Here, the layers are joined together.\nFigure Symbology 3:\n\nSingle symbol line properties \nIn any spinbox in this dialog you can enter expressions. E.g. you can calculate simple math like multiplying the existing size of a point by 3 without resorting to a calculator.\nFigure Symbology 4:\n\nExpression in Size spinbox \nIf you click on the second level in the Symbol layers dialog a ‘Data-defined override’ for nearly all settings is possible. When using a data-defined color one may want to link the color to a field ‘budged’. Here a comment functionality is inserted.\n/* This expression will return a color code depending on the field value.\n * Negative value: red\n * 0 value: yellow\n * Positive value: green\n */\nCASE\n  WHEN value Figure Symbology 5:\n\nData-defined symbol with Edit... menu\nCategorized Renderer\nThe Categorized Renderer is used to render all features from a layer, using a single user-defined symbol whose color reflects the value of a selected feature’s attribute. The Style menu allows you to select:\n\nThe attribute (using the Column listbox or the  Set column expression function, see Expressions)\nThe symbol (using the Symbol dialog)\nThe colors (using the color Ramp listbox)\n\nThen click on Classify button to create classes from the distinct value of the attribute column. Each classes can be disabled unchecking the checkbox at the left of the class name.\nYou can change symbol, value and/or label of the class, just double click on the item you want to change.\nRight-click shows a contextual menu to Copy/Paste, Change color, Change transparency, Change output unit, Change symbol width.\nThe [Advanced] button in the lower-right corner of the dialog allows you to set the fields containing rotation and size scale information. For convenience, the center of the menu lists the values of all currently selected attributes together, including the symbols that will be rendered.\nThe example in figure_symbology_6 shows the category rendering dialog used for the rivers layer of the KADAS sample dataset.\nFigure Symbology 6:\n\nCategorized Symbolizing options \nGraduated Renderer\nThe Graduated Renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using a single user-defined symbol whose color reflects the assignment of a selected feature’s attribute to a class.\nFigure Symbology 7:\n\nGraduated Symbolizing options \nLike the Categorized Renderer, the Graduated Renderer allows you to define rotation and size scale from specified columns.\nAlso, analogous to the Categorized Renderer, the Style tab allows you to select:\n\nThe attribute (using the Column listbox or the  Set column expression function, see Expressions chapter)\nThe symbol (using the Symbol Properties button)\nThe colors (using the color Ramp list)\n\nAdditionally, you can specify the number of classes and also the mode for classifying features within the classes (using the Mode list). The available modes are:\n\nEqual Interval: each class has the same size (e.g. values from 0 to 16 and 4 classes, each class has a size of 4);\nQuantile: each class will have the same number of element inside (the idea of a boxplot);\nNatural Breaks (Jenks): the variance within each class is minimal while the variance between classes is maximal;\nStandard Deviation: classes are built depending on the standard deviation of the values;\nPretty Breaks: the same of natural breaks but the extremes number of each class are integers.\n\nThe listbox in the center part of the Style menu lists the classes together with their ranges, labels and symbols that will be rendered.\nClick on Classify button to create classes using the choosen mode. Each classes can be disabled unchecking the checkbox at the left of the class name.\nYou can change symbol, value and/or label of the clic, just double clicking on the item you want to change.\nRight-click shows a contextual menu to Copy/Paste, Change color, Change transparency, Change output unit, Change symbol width.\nThe example in figure_symbology_7 shows the graduated rendering dialog for the rivers layer of the KADAS sample dataset.\nTip\nThematic maps using an expression\nCategorized and graduated thematic maps can now be created using the result of an expression. In the properties dialog for vector layers, the attribute chooser has been augmented with a  Set column expression function. So now you no longer need to write the classification attribute to a new column in your attribute table if you want the classification attribute to be a composite of multiple fields, or a formula of some sort.\nRule-based rendering\nThe Rule-based Renderer is used to render all the features from a layer, using rule based symbols whose color reflects the assignment of a selected feature’s attribute to a class. The rules are based on SQL statements. The dialog allows rule grouping by filter or scale, and you can decide if you want to enable symbol levels or use only the first-matched rule.\nThe example in figure_symbology_8 shows the rule-based rendering dialog for the rivers layer of the KADAS sample dataset.\nTo create a rule, activate an existing row by double-clicking on it, or click on ‘+’ and click on the new rule. In the Rule properties dialog, you can define a label for the rule. Press the  button to open the expression string builder. In the Function List, click on Fields and Values to view all attributes of the attribute table to be searched. To add an attribute to the field calculator Expression field, double click its name in the Fields and Values list. Generally, you can use the various fields, values and functions to construct the calculation expression, or you can just type it into the box (see Expressions). You can create a new rule by copying and pasting an existing rule with the right mouse button. You can also use the ‘ELSE’ rule that will be run if none of the other rules on that level match. The rules appear in a tree hierarchy in the map legend. Just double-klick the rules in the map legend and the Style menu of the layer properties appears showing the rule that is the background for the symbol in the tree.\nFigure Symbology 8:\n\nRule-based Symbolizing options \nPoint displacement\nThe Point Displacement Renderer works to visualize all features of a point layer, even if they have the same location. To do this, the symbols of the points are placed on a displacement circle around a center symbol.\nFigure Symbology 9:\n\nPoint displacement dialog \nTip\nExport vector symbology\nYou have the option to export vector symbology from KADAS into Google *.kml, *.dxf and MapInfo *.tab files. Just open the right mouse menu of the layer and click on Save selection as ‣ to specify the name of the output file and its format. In the dialog, use the Symbology export menu to save the symbology either as Feature symbology ‣ or as Symbol layer symbology ‣. If you have used symbol layers, it is recommended to use the second setting.\nInverted Polygon\nInverted polygon renderer allows user to define a symbol to fill in outside of the layer’s polygons. As before you can select subrenderers. These subrenderers are the same as for the main renderers.\nFigure Symbology 10:\n\nInverted Polygon dialog \nTip\nSwitch quickly between styles\nOnce you created one of the above mentioned styles you can right-klick on the layer and choose Styles ‣ Add to save your style. Now you can easily switch between styles you created using the Styles ‣ menu again.\nHeatmap\nWith the Heatmap renderer you can create live dynamic heatmaps for (multi)point layers. You can specify the heatmap radius in pixels, mm or map units, choose a color ramp for the heatmap style and use a slider for selecting a tradeoff between render speed and quality. When adding or removing a feature the heatmap renderer updates the heatmap style automatically.\nColor Picker \nRegardless the type of style to be used, the select color dialog will show when you click to choose a color - either border or fill color. This dialog has four different tabs which allow you to select colors by  color\\ ramp,  color\\ wheel,  color\\ swatches or  color\\ picker.\nWhatever method you use, the selected color is always described through color sliders for HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values. There is also an opacity slider to set transparency level. On the lower left part of the dialog you can see a comparison between the current and the new color you are presently selecting and on the lower right part you have the option to add the color you just tweaked into a color slot button.\nFigure color picker 1:\n\nColor picker ramp tab \nWith  color\\ ramp or with  color\\ wheel, you can browse to all possible color combinations. There are other possibilities though. By using color swatches  you can choose from a preselected list. This selected list is populated with one of three methods: Recent colors, Standard colors or Project colors\nFigure color picker 2:\n\nColor picker swatcher tab \nAnother option is to use the  color\\ picker which allows you to sample a color from under your mouse pointer at any part of QGIS or even from another application by pressing the space bar. Please note that the color picker is OS dependent and is currently not supported by OSX.\nTip\nquick color picker + copy/paste colors\nYou can quickly choose from Recent colors, from Standard colors or simply copy or paste a color by clicking the drop-down arrow that follows a current color box.\nFigure color picker 3:\n\nQuick color picker menu \nLayer rendering \n\nLayer transparency : You can make the underlying layer in the map canvas visible with this tool. Use the slider to adapt the visibility of your vector layer to your needs. You can also make a precise definition of the percentage of visibility in the the menu beside the slider.\n\n\n\nLayer blending mode and Feature blending mode: You can achieve special rendering effects with these tools that you may previously only know from graphics programs. The pixels of your overlaying and underlaying layers are mixed through the settings described below.\nNormal: This is the standard blend mode, which uses the alpha channel of the top pixel to blend with the pixel beneath it. The colors aren’t mixed.\nLighten: This selects the maximum of each component from the foreground and background pixels. Be aware that the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nScreen: Light pixels from the source are painted over the destination, while dark pixels are not. This mode is most useful for mixing the texture of one layer with another layer (e.g., you can use a hillshade to texture another layer).\nDodge: Dodge will brighten and saturate underlying pixels based on the lightness of the top pixel. So, brighter top pixels cause the saturation and brightness of the underlying pixels to increase. This works best if the top pixels aren’t too bright; otherwise the effect is too extreme.\nAddition: This blend mode simply adds pixel values of one layer with the other. In case of values above one (in the case of RGB), white is displayed. This mode is suitable for highlighting features.\nDarken: This creates a resultant pixel that retains the smallest components of the foreground and background pixels. Like lighten, the results tend to be jagged and harsh.\nMultiply: Here, the numbers for each pixel of the top layer are multiplied with the corresponding pixels for the bottom layer. The results are darker pictures.\nBurn: Darker colors in the top layer cause the underlying layers to darken. Burn can be used to tweak and colorise underlying layers.\nOverlay: This mode combines the multiply and screen blending modes. In the resulting picture, light parts become lighter and dark parts become darker.\nSoft light: This is very similar to overlay, but instead of using multiply/screen it uses color burn/dodge. This is supposed to emulate shining a soft light onto an image.\nHard light: Hard light is also very similar to the overlay mode. It’s supposed to emulate projecting a very intense light onto an image.\nDifference: Difference subtracts the top pixel from the bottom pixel, or the other way around, to always get a positive value. Blending with black produces no change, as the difference with all colors is zero.\nSubtract: This blend mode simply subtracts pixel values of one layer from the other. In case of negative values, black is displayed.\n\n\n\nLabels Menu \nThe  Labels core application provides smart labeling for vector point, line and polygon layers, and it only requires a few parameters. This new application also supports on-the-fly transformed layers. The core functions of the application have been redesigned. In KADAS, there are a number of other features that improve the labeling. The following menus have been created for labeling the vector layers:\n\nText\nFormatting\nBuffer\nBackground\nShadow\nPlacement\nRendering\n\nLet us see how the new menus can be used for various vector layers.\nLabeling point layers\nStart KADAS and load a vector point layer. Activate the layer in the legend and click on the  Layer\\ Labeling\\ Options icon in the KADAS toolbar menu.\nThe first step is to activate the  Label this layer with checkbox and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click  if you want to define labels based on expressions - See labeling_with_expressions.\nThe following steps describe a simple labeling without using the Data defined override functions, which are situated next to the drop-down menus.\nYou can define the text style in the Text menu (see Figure_labels_1 ). Use the Type case option to influence the text rendering. You have the possibility to render the text ‘All uppercase’, ‘All lowercase’ or ‘Capitalize first letter’. Use the blend modes to create effects known from graphics programs (see blend_modes).\nIn the Formatting menu, you can define a character for a line break in the labels with the ‘Wrap on character’ function. Use the  Formatted numbers option to format the numbers in an attribute table. Here, decimal places may be inserted. If you enable this option, three decimal places are initially set by default.\nTo create a buffer, just activate the  Draw text buffer checkbox in the Buffer menu. The buffer color is variable. Here, you can also use blend modes (see blend_modes).\nIf the  color buffer’s fill checkbox is activated, it will interact with partially transparent text and give mixed color transparency results. Turning off the buffer fill fixes that issue (except where the interior aspect of the buffer’s stroke intersects with the text’s fill) and also allows you to make outlined text.\nIn the Background menu, you can define with Size X and Size Y the shape of your background. Use Size type to insert an additional ‘Buffer’ into your background. The buffer size is set by default here. The background then consists of the buffer plus the background in Size X and Size Y. You can set a Rotation where you can choose between ‘Sync with label’, ‘Offset of label’ and ‘Fixed’. Using ‘Offset of label’ and ‘Fixed’, you can rotate the background. Define an Offset X,Y with X and Y values, and the background will be shifted. When applying Radius X,Y, the background gets rounded corners. Again, it is possible to mix the background with the underlying layers in the map canvas using the Blend mode (see blend_modes).\nUse the Shadow menu for a user-defined Drop shadow. The drawing of the background is very variable. Choose between ‘Lowest label component’, ‘Text’, ‘Buffer’ and ‘Background’. The Offset angle depends on the orientation of the label. If you choose the  Use global shadow checkbox, then the zero point of the angle is always oriented to the north and doesn’t depend on the orientation of the label. You can influence the appearance of the shadow with the Blur radius. The higher the number, the softer the shadows. The appearance of the drop shadow can also be altered by choosing a blend mode (see blend_modes).\nChoose the Placement menu for the label placement and the labeling priority. Using the  Offset from point setting, you now have the option to use Quadrants to place your label. Additionally, you can alter the angle of the label placement with the Rotation setting. Thus, a placement in a certain quadrant with a certain rotation is possible. In the priority section you can define with which priority the labels are rendered. It interacts with labels of the other vector layers in the map canvas. If there are labels from different layers in the same location then the label with the higher priority will be displayed and the other will be left out.\nIn the Rendering menu, you can define label and feature options. Under Label options, you find the scale-based visibility setting now. You can prevent KADAS from rendering only selected labels with the  Show all labels for this layer (including colliding labels) checkbox. Under Feature options, you can define whether every part of a multipart feature is to be labeled. It’s possible to define whether the number of features to be labeled is limited and to  Discourage labels from covering features.\nFigure Labels 1:\n\nSmart labeling of vector point layers \nLabeling line layers\nThe first step is to activate the  Label this layer checkbox in the Label settings tab and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click  if you want to define labels based on expressions - See labeling_with_expressions.\nAfter that, you can define the text style in the Text menu. Here, you can use the same settings as for point layers.\nAlso, in the Formatting menu, the same settings as for point layers are possible.\nThe Buffer menu has the same functions as described in section labeling_point_layers.\nThe Background menu has the same entries as described in section labeling_point_layers.\nAlso, the Shadow menu has the same entries as described in section labeling_point_layers.\nIn the Placement menu, you find special settings for line layers. The label can be placed  Parallel,  Curved or  Horizontal. With the  Parallel and  Curved option, you can define the position  Above line,  On line and  Below line. It’s possible to select several options at once. In that case, KADAS will look for the optimal position of the label. Remember that here you can also use the line orientation for the position of the label. Additionally, you can define a Maximum angle between curved characters when selecting the  Curved option (see Figure_labels_2 ).\nYou can set up a minimum distance for repeating labels. Distance can be in mm or in map units.\nSome Placement setup will display more options, for example, Curved and Parallel Placements will allow the user to set up the position of the label (above, below or on the line), distance from the line and for Curved, the user can also setup inside/outside max angle between curved label. As for point vector layers you have the possibility to define a Priority for the labels.\nThe Rendering menu has nearly the same entries as for point layers. In the Feature options, you can now Suppress labeling of features smaller than.\nFigure Labels 2:\n\nSmart labeling of vector line layers \nLabeling polygon layers\nThe first step is to activate the  Label this layer checkbox and select an attribute column to use for labeling. Click  if you want to define labels based on expressions - See labeling_with_expressions.\nIn the Text menu, define the text style. The entries are the same as for point and line layers.\nThe Formatting menu allows you to format multiple lines, also similar to the cases of point and line layers.\nAs with point and line layers, you can create a text buffer in the Buffer menu.\nUse the Background menu to create a complex user-defined background for the polygon layer. You can use the menu also as with the point and line layers.\nThe entries in the Shadow menu are the same as for point and line layers.\nIn the Placement menu, you find special settings for polygon layers (see Figure_labels_3).  Offset from centroid,  Horizontal (slow),  Around centroid,  Free and  Using perimeter are possible.\nIn the  Offset from centroid settings, you can specify if the centroid is of the  visible polygon or  whole polygon. That means that either the centroid is used for the polygon you can see on the map or the centroid is determined for the whole polygon, no matter if you can see the whole feature on the map. You can place your label with the quadrants here, and define offset and rotation. The  Around centroid setting makes it possible to place the label around the centroid with a certain distance. Again, you can define  visible polygon or  whole polygon for the centroid. With the  Using perimeter settings, you can define a position and a distance for the label. For the position,  Above line,  On line,  Below line and  Line orientation dependent position are possible.\nRelated to the choice of Label Placement, several options will appear. As for Point Placement you can choose the distance for the polygon outline, repeat the label around the polygon perimeter.\nAs for point and line vector layers you have the possibility to define a Priority for the polygon vector layer.\nThe entries in the Rendering menu are the same as for line layers. You can also use Suppress labeling of features smaller than in the Feature options.\nFigure Labels 3:\n\nSmart labeling of vector polygon layers \nDefine labels based on expressions\nQGIS allows to use expressions to label features. Just click the  icon in the  Labels menu of the properties dialog. In figure_labels_4 you see a sample expression to label the alaska regions with name and area size, based on the field ‘NAME_2’, some descriptive text and the function ‘$area()’ in combination with ‘format_number()’ to make it look nicer.\nFigure Labels 4:\n\nUsing expressions for labeling \nExpression based labeling is easy to work with. All you have to take care of is, that you need to combine all elements (strings, fields and functions) with a string concatenation sign ‘||’ and that fields a written in “double quotes” and strings in ‘single quotes’. Let’s have a look at some examples:\n # label based on two fields 'name' and 'place' with a comma as separater\n \"name\" || ', ' || \"place\"\n\n -> John Smith, Paris\n\n # label based on two fields 'name' and 'place' separated by comma\n 'My name is ' || \"name\" || 'and I live in ' || \"place\"\n\n -> My name is John Smith and I live in Paris\n\n # label based on two fields 'name' and 'place' with a descriptive text\n # and a line break (\\n)\n 'My name is ' || \"name\" || '\\nI live in ' || \"place\"\n\n -> My name is John Smith\n    I live in Paris\n\n # create a multi-line label based on a field and the $area function\n # to show the place name and its area size based on unit meter.\n 'The area of ' || \"place\" || 'has a size of ' || $area || 'm²'\n\n -> The area of Paris has a size of 105000000 m²\n\n # create a CASE ELSE condition. If the population value in field\n # population is  This place is a town\nAs you can see in the expression builder, you have hundreds of functions available to create simple and very complex expressions to label your data in QGIS. See Expressions chapter for more information and examples on expressions.\nUsing data-defined override for labeling\nWith the data-defined override functions, the settings for the labeling are overridden by entries in the attribute table. You can activate and deactivate the function with the right-mouse button. Hover over the symbol and you see the information about the data-defined override, including the current definition field. We now describe an example using the data-defined override function for the Move\\ label function (see figure_labels_5 ).\n\nImport lakes.shp from the KADAS sample dataset.\nDouble-click the layer to open the Layer Properties. Click on Labels and Placement. Select  Offset from centroid.\nLook for the Data defined entries. Click the  icon to define the field type for the Coordinate. Choose ‘xlabel’ for X and ‘ylabel’ for Y. The icons are now highlighted in yellow.\nZoom into a lake.\nGo to the Label toolbar and click the  icon. Now you can shift the label manually to another position (see figure_labels_6 ). The new position of the label is saved in the ‘xlabel’ and ‘ylabel’ columns of the attribute table.\n\nFigure Labels 5:\n\nLabeling of vector polygon layers with data-defined override \nFigure Labels 6:\n\nMove labels \nFields Menu \n Within the Fields menu, the field attributes of the selected dataset can be manipulated. The buttons  New\\ Column and  Delete\\ Column can be used when the dataset is in  Editing\\ mode.\nEdit Widget\nFigure Fields 1:\n\nDialog to select an edit widget for an attribute column \nWithin the Fields menu, you also find an edit widget column. This column can be used to define values or a range of values that are allowed to be added to the specific attribute table column. If you click on the [edit widget] button, a dialog opens, where you can define different widgets. These widgets are:\n\nCheckbox: Displays a checkbox, and you can define what attribute is added to the column when the checkbox is activated or not.\nClassification: Displays a combo box with the values used for classification, if you have chosen ‘unique value’ as legend type in the Style menu of the properties dialog.\nColor: Displays a color button allowing user to choose a color from the color dialog window.\nDate/Time: Displays a line field which can open a calendar widget to enter a date, a time or both. Column type must be text. You can select a custom format, pop-up a calendar, etc.\nEnumeration: Opens a combo box with values that can be used within the columns type. This is currently only supported by the PostgreSQL provider.\nFile name: Simplifies the selection by adding a file chooser dialog.\nHidden: A hidden attribute column is invisible. The user is not able to see its contents.\nPhoto: Field contains a filename for a picture. The width and height of the field can be defined.\nRange: Allows you to set numeric values from a specific range. The edit widget can be either a slider or a spin box.\nRelation Reference: This widged lets you embed the feature form of the referenced layer on the feature form of the actual layer. See vector_relations.\nText edit (default): This opens a text edit field that allows simple text or multiple lines to be used. If you choose multiple lines you can also choose html content.\nUnique values: You can select one of the values already used in the attribute table. If ‘Editable’ is activated, a line edit is shown with autocompletion support, otherwise a combo box is used.\nUUID Generator: Generates a read-only UUID (Universally Unique Identifiers) field, if empty.\nValue map: A combo box with predefined items. The value is stored in the attribute, the description is shown in the combo box. You can define values manually or load them from a layer or a CSV file.\nValue Relation: Offers values from a related table in a combobox. You can select layer, key column and value column.\nWebview: Field contains a URL. The width and height of the field is variable.\n\nNote\nKADAS has an advanced ‘hidden’ option to define your own field widget using python and add it to this impressive list of widgets. It is tricky but it is very well explained in following excellent blog that explains how to create a real time validation widget that can be used like described widgets. See http://blog.vitu.ch/10142013-1847/write-your-own-qgis-form-elements\nWith the Attribute editor layout, you can now define built-in forms (see figure_fields_2). This is usefull for data entry jobs or to identify objects using the option auto open form when you have objects with many attributes. You can create an editor with several tabs and named groups to present the attribute fields.\nChoose ‘Drag and drop designer’ and an attribute column. Use the  icon to create a category to insert a tab or a named group (see figure_fields_3). When creating a new category, KADAS will insert a new tab or named group for the category in the built-in form. The next step will be to assign the relevant fields to a selected category with the  icon. You can create more categories and use the same fields again.\nOther options in the dialog are ‘Autogenerate’ and ‘Provide ui-file’.\n\n‘Autogenerate’ just creates editors for all fields and tabulates them.\nThe ‘Provide ui-file’ option allows you to use complex dialogs made with the Qt-Designer. Using a UI-file allows a great deal of freedom in creating a dialog. For detailed information, see http://nathanw.net/2011/09/05/qgis-tips-custom-feature-forms-with-python-logic/.\n\nKADAS dialogs can have a Python function that is called when the dialog is opened. Use this function to add extra logic to your dialogs. An example is (in module MyForms.py):\ndef open(dialog,layer,feature):\ngeom = feature.geometry()\ncontrol = dialog.findChild(QWidged,\"My line edit\")\nReference in Python Init Function like so: MyForms.open\nMyForms.py must live on PYTHONPATH, in .qgis2/python, or inside the project folder.\nFigure Fields 2:\n\nDialog to create categories with the Attribute editor layout\nFigure Fields 3:\n\nResulting built-in form with tabs and named groups\nGeneral Menu \n Use this menu to make general settings for the vector layer. There are several options available:\nLayer Info\n\nChange the display name of the layer in displayed as\nDefine the Layer source of the vector layer\nDefine the Data source encoding to define provider-specific options and to be able to read the file\n\nCoordinate Reference System\n\nSpecify the coordinate reference system. Here, you can view or change the projection of the specific vector layer.\nCreate a Spatial Index (only for OGR-supported formats)\nUpdate Extents information for a layer\nView or change the projection of the specific vector layer, clicking on Specify ...\n\n Scale dependent visibility\n\nYou can set the Maximum (inclusive) and Minimum (exclusive) scale. The scale can also be set by the [Current] buttons.\n\nFeature subset\n\nWith the [Query Builder] button, you can create a subset of the features in the layer that will be visualized (also refer to section vector_query_builder).\n\nFigure General 1:\n\nGeneral menu in vector layers properties dialog \nRendering Menu \nKADAS supports for on-the-fly feature generalisation. This can improve rendering times when drawing many complex features at small scales. This feature can be enabled or disabled in the layer settings using the  Simplify geometry option. There is also a new global setting that enables generalisation by default for newly added layers (see section Options). Note: Feature generalisation may introduce artefacts into your rendered output in some cases. These may include slivers between polygons and inaccurate rendering when using offset-based symbol layers.\nDisplay Menu \n This menu is specifically created for Map Tips. It includes a new feature: Map Tip display text in HTML. While you can still choose a  Field to be displayed when hovering over a feature on the map, it is now possible to insert HTML code that creates a complex display when hovering over a feature. To activate Map Tips, select the menu option View ‣ MapTips. Figure Display 1 shows an example of HTML code.\nFigure Display 1:\n\nHTML code for map tip \nFigure Display 2:\n\nMap tip made with HTML code \nActions Menu \n KADAS provides the ability to perform an action based on the attributes of a feature. This can be used to perform any number of actions, for example, running a program with arguments built from the attributes of a feature or passing parameters to a web reporting tool.\nFigure Actions 1:\n\nOverview action dialog with some sample actions \nActions are useful when you frequently want to run an external application or view a web page based on one or more values in your vector layer. They are divided into six types and can be used like this:\n\nGeneric, Mac, Windows and Unix actions start an external process.\nPython actions execute a Python expression.\nGeneric and Python actions are visible everywhere.\nMac, Windows and Unix actions are visible only on the respective platform (i.e., you can define three ‘Edit’ actions to open an editor and the users can only see and execute the one ‘Edit’ action for their platform to run the editor).\n\nThere are several examples included in the dialog. You can load them by clicking on [Add default actions]. One example is performing a search based on an attribute value. This concept is used in the following discussion.\nDefining Actions\nAttribute actions are defined from the vector Layer Properties dialog. To define an action, open the vector Layer Properties dialog and click on the Actions menu. Go to the Action properties. Select ‘Generic’ as type and provide a descriptive name for the action. The action itself must contain the name of the application that will be executed when the action is invoked. You can add one or more attribute field values as arguments to the application. When the action is invoked, any set of characters that start with a % followed by the name of a field will be replaced by the value of that field. The special characters %% will be replaced by the value of the field that was selected from the identify results or attribute table (see using_actions below). Double quote marks can be used to group text into a single argument to the program, script or command. Double quotes will be ignored if preceded by a backslash.\nIf you have field names that are substrings of other field names (e.g., col1 and col10), you should indicate that by surrounding the field name (and the % character) with square brackets (e.g., [%col10]). This will prevent the %col10 field name from being mistaken for the %col1 field name with a 0 on the end. The brackets will be removed by KADAS when it substitutes in the value of the field. If you want the substituted field to be surrounded by square brackets, use a second set like this: [[%col10]].\nUsing the Identify Features tool, you can open the Identify Results dialog. It includes a (Derived) item that contains information relevant to the layer type. The values in this item can be accessed in a similar way to the other fields by preceeding the derived field name with (Derived).. For example, a point layer has an X and Y field, and the values of these fields can be used in the action with %(Derived).X and %(Derived).Y. The derived attributes are only available from the Identify Results dialog box, not the Attribute Table dialog box.\nTwo example actions are shown below:\n\nkonqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam\nkonqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%%\n\nIn the first example, the web browser konqueror is invoked and passed a URL to open. The URL performs a Google search on the value of the nam field from our vector layer. Note that the application or script called by the action must be in the path, or you must provide the full path. To be certain, we could rewrite the first example as: /opt/kde3/bin/konqueror http://www.google.com/search?q=%nam. This will ensure that the konqueror application will be executed when the action is invoked.\nThe second example uses the %% notation, which does not rely on a particular field for its value. When the action is invoked, the %% will be replaced by the value of the selected field in the identify results or attribute table.\nUsing Actions\nActions can be invoked from either the Identify Results dialog, an Attribute Table dialog or from Run Feature Action (recall that these dialogs can be opened by clicking  Identify\\ Features or  Open\\ Attribute\\ Table or  Run\\ Feature\\ Action). To invoke an action, right click on the record and choose the action from the pop-up menu. Actions are listed in the popup menu by the name you assigned when defining the action. Click on the action you wish to invoke.\nIf you are invoking an action that uses the %% notation, right-click on the field value in the Identify Results dialog or the Attribute Table dialog that you wish to pass to the application or script.\nHere is another example that pulls data out of a vector layer and inserts it into a file using bash and the echo command (so it will only work on  or perhaps ). The layer in question has fields for a species name taxon_name, latitude lat and longitude long. We would like to be able to make a spatial selection of localities and export these field values to a text file for the selected record (shown in yellow in the KADAS map area). Here is the action to achieve this:\nbash -c \"echo \\\"%taxon_name %lat %long\\\" >> /tmp/species_localities.txt\"\nAfter selecting a few localities and running the action on each one, opening the output file will show something like this:\nAcacia mearnsii -34.0800000000 150.0800000000\nAcacia mearnsii -34.9000000000 150.1200000000\nAcacia mearnsii -35.2200000000 149.9300000000\nAcacia mearnsii -32.2700000000 150.4100000000\nAs an exercise, we can create an action that does a Google search on the lakes layer. First, we need to determine the URL required to perform a search on a keyword. This is easily done by just going to Google and doing a simple search, then grabbing the URL from the address bar in your browser. From this little effort, we see that the format is http://google.com/search?q=qgis, where QGIS is the search term. Armed with this information, we can proceed:\n\nMake sure the lakes layer is loaded.\n\nOpen the Layer Properties dialog by double-clicking on the layer in the legend, or right-click and choose Properties from the pop-up menu.\n\nClick on the Actions menu.\n\nEnter a name for the action, for example Google Search.\n\nFor the action, we need to provide the name of the external program to run. In this case, we can use Firefox. If the program is not in your path, you need to provide the full path.\n\nFollowing the name of the external application, add the URL used for doing a Google search, up to but not including the search term: http://google.com/search?q=\n\nThe text in the Action field should now look like this: firefox http://google.com/search?q=\n\nClick on the drop-down box containing the field names for the lakes layer. It’s located just to the left of the [Insert Field] button.\n\nFrom the drop-down box, select ‘NAMES’ and click [Insert Field].\n\nYour action text now looks like this:\nfirefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES\n\nTo finalize the action, click the [Add to action list] button.\n\n\nThis completes the action, and it is ready to use. The final text of the action should look like this:\nfirefox http://google.com/search?q=%NAMES\nWe can now use the action. Close the Layer Properties dialog and zoom in to an area of interest. Make sure the lakes layer is active and identify a lake. In the result box you’ll now see that our action is visible:\nFigure Actions 2:\n\nSelect feature and choose action \nWhen we click on the action, it brings up Firefox and navigates to the URL http://www.google.com/search?q=Tustumena. It is also possible to add further attribute fields to the action. Therefore, you can add a + to the end of the action text, select another field and click on [Insert Field]. In this example, there is just no other field available that would make sense to search for.\nYou can define multiple actions for a layer, and each will show up in the Identify Results dialog.\nThere are all kinds of uses for actions. For example, if you have a point layer containing locations of images or photos along with a file name, you could create an action to launch a viewer to display the image. You could also use actions to launch web-based reports for an attribute field or combination of fields, specifying them in the same way we did in our Google search example.\nWe can also make more complex examples, for instance, using Python actions.\nUsually, when we create an action to open a file with an external application, we can use absolute paths, or eventually relative paths. In the second case, the path is relative to the location of the external program executable file. But what about if we need to use relative paths, relative to the selected layer (a file-based one, like a shapefile or SpatiaLite)? The following code will do the trick:\ncommand = \"firefox\";\nimagerelpath = \"images_test/test_image.jpg\";\nlayer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer();\nimport os.path;\nlayerpath = layer.source() if layer.providerType() == 'ogr'\n  else (qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI(layer.source()).database()\n  if layer.providerType() == 'spatialite' else None);\npath = os.path.dirname(str(layerpath));\nimage = os.path.join(path,imagerelpath);\nimport subprocess;\nsubprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );\nWe just have to remember that the action is one of type Python and the command and imagerelpath variables must be changed to fit our needs.\nBut what about if the relative path needs to be relative to the (saved) project file? The code of the Python action would be:\ncommand=\"firefox\";\nimagerelpath=\"images/test_image.jpg\";\nprojectpath=qgis.core.QgsProject.instance().fileName();\nimport os.path; path=os.path.dirname(str(projectpath)) if projectpath != '' else None;\nimage=os.path.join(path, imagerelpath);\nimport subprocess;\nsubprocess.Popen( [command, image ] );\nAnother Python action example is the one that allows us to add new layers to the project. For instance, the following examples will add to the project respectively a vector and a raster. The names of the files to be added to the project and the names to be given to the layers are data driven (filename and layername are column names of the table of attributes of the vector where the action was created):\nqgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer('/yourpath/[% \"filename\" %].shp','[% \"layername\" %]',\n  'ogr')\nTo add a raster (a TIF image in this example), it becomes:\nqgis.utils.iface.addRasterLayer('/yourpath/[% \"filename\" %].tif','[% \"layername\" %]\n')\nJoins Menu \n The Joins menu allows you to join a loaded attribute table to a loaded vector layer. After clicking , the Add vector join dialog appears. As key columns, you have to define a join layer you want to connect with the target vector layer. Then, you have to specify the join field that is common to both the join layer and the target layer. Now you can also specify a subset of fields from the joined layer based on the checkbox  Choose which fields are joined. As a result of the join, all information from the join layer and the target layer are displayed in the attribute table of the target layer as joined information. If you specified a subset of fields only these fields are displayed in the attribute table of the target layer.\nKADAS currently has support for joining non-spatial table formats supported by OGR (e.g., CSV, DBF and Excel), delimited text and the PostgreSQL provider (see figure_joins_1).\nFigure Joins 1:\n\nJoin an attribute table to an existing vector layer \nAdditionally, the add vector join dialog allows you to:\n\n Cache join layer in virtual memory\n Create attribute index on the join field\n Choose which fields are joined\nCreate a  Custom field name prefix\n\nDiagrams Menu \n The Diagrams menu allows you to add a graphic overlay to a vector layer (see figure_diagrams_1).\nThe current core implementation of diagrams provides support for pie charts, text diagrams and histograms.\nThe menu is divided into four tabs: Appearance, Size, Postion and Options.\nIn the cases of the text diagram and pie chart, text values of different data columns are displayed one below the other with a circle or a box and dividers. In the Size tab, diagram size is based on a fixed size or on linear scaling according to a classification attribute. The placement of the diagrams, which is done in the Position tab, interacts with the new labeling, so position conflicts between diagrams and labels are detected and solved. In addition, chart positions can be fixed manually.\nFigure Diagrams 1:\n\nVector properties dialog with diagram menu \nWe will demonstrate an example and overlay on the Alaska boundary layer a text diagram showing temperature data from a climate vector layer. Both vector layers are part of the KADAS sample dataset (see section Sample Data).\n\nFirst, click on the  Load\\ Vector icon, browse to the KADAS sample dataset folder, and load the two vector shape layers alaska.shp and climate.shp.\nDouble click the climate layer in the map legend to open the Layer Properties dialog.\nClick on the Diagrams menu, activate Display diagrams, and from the Diagram type  combo box, select ‘Text diagram’.\nIn the Appearance tab, we choose a light blue as background color, and in the Size tab, we set a fixed size to 18 mm.\nIn the Position tab, placement could be set to ‘Around Point’.\nIn the diagram, we want to display the values of the three columns T_F_JAN, T_F_JUL and T_F_MEAN. First select T_F_JAN as Attributes and click the  button, then T_F_JUL, and finally T_F_MEAN.\nNow click [Apply] to display the diagram in the KADAS main window.\nYou can adapt the chart size in the Size tab. Deactivate the  Fixed size and set the size of the diagrams on the basis of an attribute with the [Find maximum value] button and the Size menu. If the diagrams appear too small on the screen, you can activate the  Increase size of small diagrams checkbox and define the minimum size of the diagrams.\nChange the attribute colors by double clicking on the color values in the Assigned attributes field. Figure_diagrams_2 gives an idea of the result.\nFinally, click [Ok].\n\nFigure Diagrams 2:\n\nDiagram from temperature data overlayed on a map \nRemember that in the Position tab, a  Data defined position of the diagrams is possible. Here, you can use attributes to define the position of the diagram. You can also set a scale-dependent visibility in the Appearance tab.\nThe size and the attributes can also be an expression. Use the  button to add an expression. See Expressions chapter for more information and example.\nMetadata Menu \n The Metadata menu consists of Description, Attribution, MetadataURL and Properties sections.\nIn the Properties section, you get general information about the layer, including specifics about the type and location, number of features, feature type, and editing capabilities. The Extents table provides you with layer extent information and the Layer Spatial Reference System, which is information about the CRS of the layer. This is a quick way to get information about the layer.\nAdditionally, you can add or edit a title and abstract for the layer in the Description section. It’s also possible to define a Keyword list here. These keyword lists can be used in a metadata catalogue. If you want to use a title from an XML metadata file, you have to fill in a link in the DataUrl field. Use Attribution to get attribute data from an XML metadata catalogue. In MetadataUrl, you can define the general path to the XML metadata catalogue. This information will be saved in the KADAS project file for subsequent sessions and will be used for KADAS server.\nFigure Metadata 1:\n\nMetadata menu in vector layers properties dialog \n"},"working_with_vector/expression.html":{"url":"working_with_vector/expression.html","title":"Expressions","keywords":"","body":"Expressions \nThe Expressions feature are available through the field calculator or the add a new column button in the attribut table or the Field tab in the Layer properties ; through the graduaded, categorized and rule-based rendering in the Style tab of the Layer properties ; through the expression-based labeling  in the  Labeling core application ; through the feature selection and through the diagram tab of the Layer properties as well as the Main properties of the label item and the Atlas generation tab in the Print Composer.\nThey are a powerful way to manipulate attribute value in order to dynamically change the final value in order to change the geometry style, the content of the label, the value for diagram, select some feature or create virtual column.\nFunctions List \nThe Function List contains functions as well as fields and values. View the help function in the Selected Function Help. In Expression you see the calculation expressions you create with the Function List. For the most commonly used operators, see Operators.\nIn the Function List, click on Fields and Values to view all attributes of the attribute table to be searched. To add an attribute to the Field calculator Expression field, double click its name in the Fields and Values list. Generally, you can use the various fields, values and functions to construct the calculation expression, or you can just type it into the box. To display the values of a field, you just right click on the appropriate field. You can choose between Load top 10 unique values and Load all unique values. On the right side, the Field Values list opens with the unique values. To add a value to the Field calculator Expression box, double click its name in the Field Values list.\nThe Operators, Math, Conversions, String, Geometry and Record groups provide several functions. In Operators, you find mathematical operators. Look in Math for mathematical functions. The Conversions group contains functions that convert one data type to another. The String group provides functions for data strings. In the Geometry group, you find functions for geometry objects. With Record group functions, you can add a numeration to your data set. To add a function to the Field calculator Expression box, click on the > and then double click the function.\nOperators \nThis group contains operators (e.g., +, -, *).\na + b      a plus b\na - b      a minus b\na * b      a multiplied by b\na / b      a divided by b\na % b      a modulo b (for example, 7 % 2 = 1, or 2 fits into 7 three\n           times with remainder 1)\na ^ b      a power b (for example, 2^2=4 or 2^3=8)\na = b      a and b are equal\na > b      a is larger than b\na  b     a and b are not equal\na != b     a and b are not equal\na = b     a is larger than or equal to b\na ~ b      a matches the regular expression b\n+ a        positive sign\n- a        negative value of a\n||         joins two values together into a string 'Hello' || ' world'\nLIKE       returns 1 if the string matches the supplied pattern\nILIKE      returns 1 if the string matches case-insensitive the supplied\n           pattern (ILIKE can be used instead of LIKE to make the match\n           case-insensitive)\nIS         returns 1 if a is the same as b\nOR         returns 1 when condition a or b is true\nAND        returns 1 when condition a and b are true\nNOT        returns 1 if a is not the same as b\ncolumn name \"column name\"     value of the field column name, take\n                              care to not be confused with simple\n                              quote, see

              a has no value\na IS NOT NULL                 a has a value\na IN (value[,value])          a is below the values listed\na NOT IN (value[,value])      a is not below the values listed\nSome examples:\n\nJoins a string and a value from a column name:\n'My feature's id is: ' || \"gid\"\n\nTest if the “description” attribute field starts with the ‘Hello’ string in the value (note the position of the % character):\n\"description\" LIKE 'Hello%'\n\n\nConditionals \nThis group contains functions to handle conditional checks in expressions.\nCASE

Values or string should be simple-quoted.\n"},"working_with_vector/field_calculator.html":{"url":"working_with_vector/field_calculator.html","title":"Field Calculator","keywords":"","body":"Field Calculator \nThe  Field\\ Calculator button in the attribute table allows you to perform calculations on the basis of existing attribute values or defined functions, for instance, to calculate length or area of geometry features. The results can be written to a new attribute field, a virtual field, or they can be used to update values in an existing field.\nTip\nVirtual Fields\n\nVirtual fields are not permanent and are not saved.\nTo make a field virtual it must be done when the field is made.\n\nThe field calculator is now available on any layer that supports edit. When you click on the field calculator icon the dialog opens (see figure_attributes_3). If the layer is not in edit mode, a warning is displayed and using the field calculator will cause the layer to be put in edit mode before the calculation is made.\nThe quick field calculation bar on top of the attribute table is only visible if the layer is editable.\nIn quick field calculation bar, you first select the existing field name then open the expression dialog to create your expression or write it directly in the field then click on Update All button.\nExpression tab \nIn the field calculator dialog, you first must select whether you want to only update selected features, create a new attribute field where the results of the calculation will be added or update an existing field.\nFigure Attributes 3:\n\nField Calculator \nIf you choose to add a new field, you need to enter a field name, a field type (integer, real or string), the total field width, and the field precision (see figure_attributes_3). For example, if you choose a field width of 10 and a field precision of 3, it means you have 6 digits before the dot, then the dot and another 3 digits for the precision.\nA short example illustrates how field calculator works when using the Expression tab. We want to calculate the length in km of the railroads layer from the KADAS sample dataset:\n\nLoad the shapefile railroads.shp in KADAS and press  Open\\ Attribute\\ Table.\nClick on  Toggle\\ editing\\ mode and open the  Field\\ Calculator dialog.\nSelect the  Create a new field checkbox to save the calculations into a new field.\nAdd length as Output field name and real as Output field type, and define Output field width to be 10 and Precision, 3.\nNow double click on function $length in the Geometry group to add it into the Field calculator expression box.\nComplete the expression by typing ‘’/ 1000’’ in the Field calculator expression box and click [Ok].\nYou can now find a new field length in the attribute table.\n\nThe available functions are listed in Expressions chapter.\nFunction Editor tab \nWith the Function Editor you are able to define your own Python custom functions in a comfortable way. The function editor will create new Python files in qgis2pythonexpressions and will auto load all functions defined when starting QGIS. Be aware that new functions are only saved in the expressions folder and not in the project file. If you have a project that uses one of your custom functions you will need to also share the .py file in the expressions folder.\nHere’s a short example on how to create your own functions:\n@qgsfunction(args=\"auto\", group='Custom')\ndef myfunc(value1, value2 feature, parent):\n    pass\nThe short example creates a function ‘myfunc’ that will give you a function with two values. When using the args=’auto’ function argument the number of function arguments required will be calculated by the number of arguments the function has been defined with in Python (minus 2 - feature, and parent).\nThis function then can be used with the following expression:\nmyfunc('test1', 'test2')\nYour function will be implemented in the ‘Custom’ Functions of the Expression tab after using the Run Script button.\nFurther information about creating Python code can be found on http://www.qgis.org/html/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html.\nThe function editor is not only limited to working with the field calculator, it can be found whenever you work with expressions. See also Expressions.\n"},"working_with_raster/supported_data.html":{"url":"working_with_raster/supported_data.html","title":"Working with Raster Data","keywords":"","body":"Working with Raster Data \nThis section describes how to visualize and set raster layer properties. KADAS uses the GDAL library to read and write raster data formats, including ArcInfo Binary Grid, ArcInfo ASCII Grid, GeoTIFF, ERDAS IMAGINE, and many more. GRASS raster support is supplied by a native KADAS data provider plugin. The raster data can also be loaded in read mode from zip and gzip archives into KADAS.\nAs of the date of this document, more than 100 raster formats are supported by the GDAL library (see GDAL-SOFTWARE-SUITE in literature_and_web). A complete list is available at http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html.\nNote\nNot all of the listed formats may work in KADAS for various reasons. For example, some require external commercial libraries, or the GDAL installation of your OS may not have been built to support the format you want to use. Only those formats that have been well tested will appear in the list of file types when loading a raster into KADAS. Other untested formats can be loaded by selecting the [GDAL] All files (*) filter.\nWhat is raster data? \nRaster data in GIS are matrices of discrete cells that represent features on, above or below the earth’s surface. Each cell in the raster grid is the same size, and cells are usually rectangular (in KADAS they will always be rectangular). Typical raster datasets include remote sensing data, such as aerial photography, or satellite imagery and modelled data, such as an elevation matrix.\nUnlike vector data, raster data typically do not have an associated database record for each cell. They are geocoded by pixel resolution and the x/y coordinate of a corner pixel of the raster layer. This allows KADAS to position the data correctly in the map canvas.\nKADAS makes use of georeference information inside the raster layer (e.g., GeoTiff) or in an appropriate world file to properly display the data.\n"},"working_with_raster/raster_properties.html":{"url":"working_with_raster/raster_properties.html","title":"Raster Properties Dialog","keywords":"","body":"Raster Properties Dialog \nTo view and set the properties for a raster layer, double click on the layer name in the map legend, or right click on the layer name and choose Properties from the context menu. This will open the Raster Layer Properties dialog (see figure_raster_1).\nThere are several menus in the dialog:\n\nGeneral\nStyle\nTransparency\nPyramids\nHistogram\nMetadata\n\nFigure Raster 1:\n\nRaster Layers Properties Dialog \nGeneral Menu \nLayer Info \nThe General menu displays basic information about the selected raster, including the layer source path, the display name in the legend (which can be modified), and the number of columns, rows and no-data values of the raster.\nCoordinate reference system \nHere, you find the coordinate reference system (CRS) information printed as a PROJ.4 string. If this setting is not correct, it can be modified by clicking the [Specify] button.\nScale Dependent visibility \nAdditionally scale-dependent visibility can be set in this tab. You will need to check the checkbox and set an appropriate scale where your data will be displayed in the map canvas.\nAt the bottom, you can see a thumbnail of the layer, its legend symbol, and the palette.\nStyle Menu \nBand rendering \nKADAS offers four different Render types. The renderer chosen is dependent on the data type.\n\nMultiband color - if the file comes as a multiband with several bands (e.g., used with a satellite image with several bands)\nPaletted - if a single band file comes with an indexed palette (e.g., used with a digital topographic map)\nSingleband gray - (one band of) the image will be rendered as gray; KADAS will choose this renderer if the file has neither multibands nor an indexed palette nor a continous palette (e.g., used with a shaded relief map)\nSingleband pseudocolor - this renderer is possible for files with a continuous palette, or color map (e.g., used with an elevation map)\n\nMultiband color\nWith the multiband color renderer, three selected bands from the image will be rendered, each band representing the red, green or blue component that will be used to create a color image. You can choose several Contrast enhancement methods: ‘No enhancement’, ‘Stretch to MinMax’, ‘Stretch and clip to MinMax’ and ‘Clip to min max’.\nFigure Raster 2:\n\nRaster Renderer - Multiband color \nThis selection offers you a wide range of options to modify the appearance of your raster layer. First of all, you have to get the data range from your image. This can be done by choosing the Extent and pressing [Load]. KADAS can  Estimate (faster) the Min and Max values of the bands or use the  Actual (slower) Accuracy.\nNow you can scale the colors with the help of the Load min/max values section. A lot of images have a few very low and high data. These outliers can be eliminated using the  Cumulative count cut setting. The standard data range is set from 2% to 98% of the data values and can be adapted manually. With this setting, the gray character of the image can disappear. With the scaling option  Min/max, KADAS creates a color table with all of the data included in the original image (e.g., KADAS creates a color table with 256 values, given the fact that you have 8 bit bands). You can also calculate your color table using the  Mean +/- standard deviation x . Then, only the values within the standard deviation or within multiple standard deviations are considered for the color table. This is useful when you have one or two cells with abnormally high values in a raster grid that are having a negative impact on the rendering of the raster.\nAll calculations can also be made for the  Current extent.\nTip\nViewing a Single Band of a Multiband Raster\nIf you want to view a single band of a multiband image (for example, Red), you might think you would set the Green and Blue bands to “Not Set”. But this is not the correct way. To display the Red band, set the image type to ‘Singleband gray’, then select Red as the band to use for Gray.\nPaletted\nThis is the standard render option for singleband files that already include a color table, where each pixel value is assigned to a certain color. In that case, the palette is rendered automatically. If you want to change colors assigned to certain values, just double-click on the color and the Select color dialog appears. Also, in KADAS 2.2. it’s now possible to assign a label to the color values. The label appears in the legend of the raster layer then.\nFigure Raster 3:\n\nRaster Renderer - Paletted \nContrast enhancement\nNote\nWhen adding GRASS rasters, the option Contrast enhancement will always be set automatically to stretch to min max, regardless of if this is set to another value in the KADAS general options.\nSingleband gray\nThis renderer allows you to render a single band layer with a Color gradient: ‘Black to white’ or ‘White to black’. You can define a Min and a Max value by choosing the Extent first and then pressing [Load]. KADAS can  Estimate (faster) the Min and Max values of the bands or use the  Actual (slower) Accuracy.\nFigure Raster 4:\n\nRaster Renderer - Singleband gray \nWith the Load min/max values section, scaling of the color table is possible. Outliers can be eliminated using the  Cumulative count cut setting. The standard data range is set from 2% to 98% of the data values and can be adapted manually. With this setting, the gray character of the image can disappear. Further settings can be made with  Min/max and  Mean +/- standard deviation x . While the first one creates a color table with all of the data included in the original image, the second creates a color table that only considers values within the standard deviation or within multiple standard deviations. This is useful when you have one or two cells with abnormally high values in a raster grid that are having a negative impact on the rendering of the raster.\nSingleband pseudocolor\nThis is a render option for single-band files, including a continous palette. You can also create individual color maps for the single bands here.\nFigure Raster 5:\n\nRaster Renderer - Singleband pseudocolor \nThree types of color interpolation are available:\n\nDiscrete\nLinear\nExact\n\nIn the left block, the button  Add\\ values\\ manually adds a value to the individual color table. The button  Remove\\ selected\\ row deletes a value from the individual color table, and the  Sort\\ colormap\\ items button sorts the color table according to the pixel values in the value column. Double clicking on the value column lets you insert a specific value. Double clicking on the color column opens the dialog Change color, where you can select a color to apply on that value. Further, you can also add labels for each color, but this value won’t be displayed when you use the identify feature tool. You can also click on the button  Load\\ color\\ map\\ from\\ band, which tries to load the table from the band (if it has any). And you can use the buttons  Load\\ color\\ map\\ from\\ file or  Export\\ color\\ map\\ to\\ file to load an existing color table or to save the defined color table for other sessions.\nIn the right block, Generate new color map allows you to create newly categorized color maps. For the Classification mode  ‘Equal interval’, you only need to select the number of classes  and press the button Classify. You can invert the colors of the color map by clicking the  Invert checkbox. In the case of the Mode  ‘Continous’, KADAS creates classes automatically depending on the Min and Max. Defining Min/Max values can be done with the help of the Load min/max values section. A lot of images have a few very low and high data. These outliers can be eliminated using the  Cumulative count cut setting. The standard data range is set from 2% to 98% of the data values and can be adapted manually. With this setting, the gray character of the image can disappear. With the scaling option  Min/max, KADAS creates a color table with all of the data included in the original image (e.g., KADAS creates a color table with 256 values, given the fact that you have 8 bit bands). You can also calculate your color table using the  Mean +/- standard deviation x . Then, only the values within the standard deviation or within multiple standard deviations are considered for the color table.\nColor rendering \nFor every Band rendering, a Color rendering is possible.\nYou can also achieve special rendering effects for your raster file(s) using one of the blending modes (see The Vector Properties Dialog).\nFurther settings can be made in modifiying the Brightness, the Saturation and the Contrast. You can also use a Grayscale option, where you can choose between ‘By lightness’, ‘By luminosity’ and ‘By average’. For one hue in the color table, you can modify the ‘Strength’.\nResampling \nThe Resampling option makes its appearance when you zoom in and out of an image. Resampling modes can optimize the appearance of the map. They calculate a new gray value matrix through a geometric transformation.\nFigure Raster 6:\n\nRaster Rendering - Resampling \nWhen applying the ‘Nearest neighbour’ method, the map can have a pixelated structure when zooming in. This appearance can be improved by using the ‘Bilinear’ or ‘Cubic’ method, which cause sharp features to be blurred. The effect is a smoother image. This method can be applied, for instance, to digital topographic raster maps.\nTransparency Menu \nKADAS has the ability to display each raster layer at a different transparency level. Use the transparency slider  to indicate to what extent the underlying layers (if any) should be visible though the current raster layer. This is very useful if you like to overlay more than one raster layer (e.g., a shaded relief map overlayed by a classified raster map). This will make the look of the map more three dimensional.\nAdditionally, you can enter a raster value that should be treated as NODATA in the Additional no data value menu.\nAn even more flexible way to customize the transparency can be done in the Custom transparency options section. The transparency of every pixel can be set here.\nAs an example, we want to set the water of our example raster file landcover.tif to a transparency of 20%. The following steps are neccessary:\n\nLoad the raster file landcover.tif.\nOpen the Properties dialog by double-clicking on the raster name in the legend, or by right-clicking and choosing Properties from the pop-up menu.\nSelect the Transparency menu.\nFrom the Transparency band menu, choose ‘None’.\nClick the  Add\\ values\\ manually button. A new row will appear in the pixel list.\nEnter the raster value in the ‘From’ and ‘To’ column (we use 0 here), and adjust the transparency to 20%.\nPress the [Apply] button and have a look at the map.\n\nYou can repeat steps 5 and 6 to adjust more values with custom transparency.\nAs you can see, it is quite easy to set custom transparency, but it can be quite a lot of work. Therefore, you can use the button  Export\\ to\\ file to save your transparency list to a file. The button  Import\\ from\\ file loads your transparency settings and applies them to the current raster layer.\nMetadata Menu \nThe Metadata menu displays a wealth of information about the raster layer, including statistics about each band in the current raster layer. From this menu, entries may be made for the Description, Attribution, MetadataUrl and Properties. In Properties, statistics are gathered on a ‘need to know’ basis, so it may well be that a given layer’s statistics have not yet been collected.\nFigure Raster 9:\n\nRaster Metadata \n"},"appendices/appendices.html":{"url":"appendices/appendices.html","title":"Appendix","keywords":"","body":"Appendix \nGNU General Public License \nVersion 2, June 1991\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\nPreamble\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software–to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\nAlso, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors’ reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\nThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The “Program”, below, refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.) Each licensee is addressed as “you”.\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\nYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\nYou must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\nYou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\nIf the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\nYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\nAccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nAccompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\nAccompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\nEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nQGIS Qt exception for GPL\n\nIn addition, as a special exception, the QGIS Development Team gives permission to link the code of this program with the Qt library, including but not limited to the following versions (both free and commercial): Qt/Non-commerical Windows, Qt/Windows, Qt/X11, Qt/Mac, and Qt/Embedded (or with modified versions of Qt that use the same license as Qt), and distribute linked combinations including the two. You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the code used other than Qt. If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n\nGNU Free Documentation License \n\nVersion 1.3, 3 November 2008\nCopyright 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc\nhttp://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The Document, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\nA “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\nThe “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.\nA “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called Opaque.\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\nThe “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.\nThe “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.\nA section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n\nUse in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nList on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.\nState on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.\nPreserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\nAdd an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.\nInclude, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.\nPreserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.\nInclude an unaltered copy of this License.\nPreserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.\nPreserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the “History” section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.\nFor any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\nPreserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.\nDelete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.\nDo not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.\nPreserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\n\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements”.\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\n11. RELICENSING\n“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.\n“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.\nAn MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\n\nCopyright © YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled “GNU Free Documentation License”.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the “with ... Texts.” line with this:\n\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\n\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n"}}}
